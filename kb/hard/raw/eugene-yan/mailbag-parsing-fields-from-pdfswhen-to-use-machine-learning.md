Hey K, thanks for reaching out! I think in this case, you have an excellent solution already—99% recall (i.e., error in 1 out of 100) is a great result.

Now, about those errors:

* For misspellings in the word “quote”, I think this can be resolved to some extent with [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance).
* I.e., for each word, how many characters do we have to change so that word becomes “quote”
* “qoute” would need two char changes while “route” would need one char change
* We can also combine this with a calculation of the proportion of characters that are exactly the same as “quote”.
* Thus, “qoute” would have a 100% match, while “route” would have a 80% match.
* Together, the two approaches should help with finding misspellings for “quote”.

About errors in the quote number itself: This is tricky.

* If we can find a quote in the database that is close enough tot he quote in the PDF (based on the two approaches above) and have identical value, we should flag that.
* Nonetheless, I think it’s best to flag these for a human to inspect and manually accept the error correction.
* What we don’t want is to erroneously find quotes that aren’t in the database.
* This would depend on how unique the quote values in your database are. If they’re are recurring quotes with identical values, we might have to match on date as well.

In both cases, I think using deterministic logic is far simpler, faster, and easier than machine learning. ML will have some error, and would be unlikely to improve on the 99% recall that you already have.

Yes, of course! IMO 99% recall is excellent.
