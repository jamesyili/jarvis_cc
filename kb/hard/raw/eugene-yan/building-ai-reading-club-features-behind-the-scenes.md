How can AI make reading more enjoyable? What would an AI-powered reading experience look like? Inspired by a [discussion](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1866902647804203363) between Andrej Karpathy and Patrick Collison, I built a simple prototype to explore some ideas. (Try it at [AiReadingClub.com](https://aireadingclub.com)!) In this write-up, I’ll walk through key features, design considerations, and how it was built.

## Meet Dewey and its features

At the heart of AI Reading Club is Dewey, our AI reading companion. Dewey is designed to help readers get more out of reading with a few simple features.

**Understanding your context.** Dewey understands our current context via the text we select or the page we’re on. This *explicit* context is displayed during discussions to make clear what Dewey is focused on. Behind the scenes, Dewey can also retrieve and consider the rest of the book as *implicit* context to enrich its understanding and improve its responses, such as when using the “Recap” or “Look up in book” feature (see below).

Dewey understands your context (example from [Meditations](https://aireadingclub.com/read/2680))

**Answering simple queries.** With the provided context, Dewey can help clarify the material, explain complex sections, or discuss various perspectives. This helps us better understand the book. The goal is to keep us in flow while reading, instead of having to reread other sections of the book or open a web browser for our queries.

Dewey answers simple queries (example from [A History of Science](https://aireadingclub.com/read/1707))

**Creating quizzes/flashcards.** Dewey can also test our knowledge of the selected text. This helps reinforce our learning and improve knowledge retention.

**Recapping the book so far.** It can be challenging to resume a book we’ve stopped reading for a while. To help with this, Dewey can summarize the book up to the current page, refreshing our memory and highlighting major themes, characters, and concepts.

Dewey recaps the book (example from [Alice's Adventures in Wonderland](https://aireadingclub.com/read/11))

**Look up in book.** If we need help with a term or character that was previously mentioned, Dewey can help with a summary so we don’t have to look it up ourselves.

Dewey looks up and summarizes a term (example from [The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes](https://aireadingclub.com/read/1661))

**Revisiting past discussions.** Past discussions are indicated by a small icon next to each paragraph. We can click on it to review that discussion. Alternatively, we can browse all discussions in Dewey’s side pane to refresh our memory without repeating interactions.

## UX design considerations

While building AI Reading Club and Dewey, the goal was to create a clean, intuitive UI that enhances the reading experience without distractions. The AI-powered features should be seamless to access while keeping the focus on the text. Here are some things I considered.

**Reading pane.** The reading pane prioritizes simplicity, presenting the text cleanly with minimal markup. Thus, instead of using conventional highlights to indicate past conversations, I attached less obtrusive “stickies” to the relevant paragraphs. This keeps the text clean while making it easy to access Dewey.

**Dewey.** The AI-powered features are designed to be available when needed and out of the way when not. Dewey is only called up when we select text or click the Dewey button. I opted for a chat-like interface that displays the context explicitly provided and distinguishes reader input from AI responses.

**User input.** The goal is to simplify interactions and minimize keystrokes. For common queries, we can click on predefined options to save effort and streamline the process. For more nuanced queries, we can always type our own. This flexibility ensures we get the most out of Dewey regardless of our needs.

**Past discussions.** I tried to make it easy to revisit past discussions through stickies next to paragraphs and the bottom of Dewey’s conversation pane. Both methods avoid obscuring the text, ensuring the reading experience remains central.

## Building AI Reading Club, Step-by-Step

Here’s a high-level overview of how I built AI Reading Club, from defining requirements to designing wireframes and database schema to building out the UI and backend.

**Defining requirements.** To begin, I worked with Claude to write product requirements based on this [thread](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1866902647804203363) using the [Moscow method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method). This provided direction on what the app would look like. The current app implements the requirements in the must-haves section.

> Claude, you are a world-class product manager who brings to life cutting-edge experiences to millions of users worldwide.
>
> Recently, there has been a lot of interest in an AI reading companion, whereby users can read books in their apps and talk to AIs about it. Here are some example tweets about it.
>
> <tweets>  
> text from [tweet thread](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1866902647804203363)  
> </tweets>
>
> We want to create a minimum lovable web app for this reading experience. For the V1, we will seed the library with books from the Gutenberg project. Focus on the user experience and UI of the web app.
>
> Please list the core features of this web app. Use the Moscow framework. What are the must haves, what are the should haves, what are the could haves and what are the won’t haves.

**Designing the UI.** With the requirements in hand, I worked with Claude to create SVG wireframes for desktop and mobile. Here’s the prompt to create the initial wireframe.

> Thanks Claude! Next, please create a wireframe of how the app should look.

The initial wireframe Claude suggested was more complex than I’d like. It also had each book taking up more space than required.

Nonetheless, with a little prompting, Claude was able to simplify it to suit my needs.

> Can you simplify it for the library screen layout please? We just need a list of books, with the title being the main component of the list and the author and genres being the sub components. Clicking on the title should navigate to the reading screen for the book.

Updated library wireframe by Claude

Over several iterations, we shaped the UI for the library, reading pane, and AI assistant pane. Along the way, we learned that we needed two separate views, one for the library and another for the reading view, and updated the product requirements accordingly. An early iteration (below) felt cluttered and distracted from the reading experience.

**Designing the database schema.** With the product requirements and user interface clarified, I asked Claude to design the data layer.

> Thank you! Next, can you create the database design please?
>
> * what are the tables that we need?
> * what are their purposes?
> * what are their relationships?

The initial proposal was fairly complex, with multiple tables for books, genres, reading progress, user preference, AI conversations, and more. On hindsight, this was probably due to my prompt mentioning “tables” and “relationships”. Thus, I prompted Claude to simplify the schema into a single table that contained all the essential metadata.

> That seems really complicated. We just need a single table, books, which has all metadata on title, author, genre, text of the book, etc.
>
> Also, can you suggest how to store the book text in the database please? What types of database should we consider?

**Defining tasks.** With the above done, it was time to create a task breakdown. Here’s how I prompted Claude to generate the list of tasks to implement the must-have features, mapping each task to its associated requirement and feature.

> Thank you Claude. Next, we need to create the task list to create the must-haves of this web app. Could you list the tasks that need to be done, as well as the associated requirement and feature please?

**Building the UI.** With the work documents done, the next task was to build a skeleton UI. For this, I turned to [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/) and created a new project with the must-have requirements as the project instructions. While I had more documentation (e.g., full requirements, database design, UI, task list), I kept it simple and see how v0 would surprise me with a different design or opinion. Then, I asked v0 to bootstrap a simple skeleton for the app.

> v0, you are a world class frontend designer and developer. We are designing and building an app to help people read more, and more effectively. The app should have two screens:
>
> * Library Screen: Shows a list of books with basic metadata
> * Reading Screen: Shows the content of the book with clean, beautiful reading experience. It should also have an AI assistant feature where users can highlight a section to pull up the AI assistant, or click on a button. The AI assistant should be hidden away until called.
>
> First, create the Library screen. It should be aesthetically pleasing with a simple list view.

Surprisingly, v0’s initial implementation of the library screen felt clunky and took up a lot of screen real estate per book.

Nonetheless, it was easy to get v0 to simplify the design with the prompt below. Providing the previous SVG wireframe of the Library screen helped. This back-and-forth continued for several iterations, including the creation of seed data to test features like navigation, scrolling, calling up the AI Assistant, and more.

> We don’t need each book’s card to take up so much space. We just want a simple list, like this provided SVG.

**Developing the app.** With a working UI, I migrated the code to [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) for the rest of the (backend) development. Within Cursor, I integrated the UI with the database and relevant API providers. Additional feature requirements and designs (e.g., database design) were also defined and implemented directly in Cursor. For example, the features to “Look up in book” and revisit past messages were not part of the initial requirements.

Here’s what AI Reading Club is built on:

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): React framework that handles both frontend web client and backend server.
* [Supabase](https://supabase.com/): PostgreSQL database with user-friendly interface; was easy to get started with and had excellent documentation
* API providers ([Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)): Leading AI providers. Gemini Flash is the default option for Dewey due to its long context length and generous free tier.
* [Railway](https://railway.app/): Easy deployment, scaling, and logging via `railway up`.

Given more time (read: longer vacation), I would add the following features:

* Voice input (and optional voice output) for a more hands-free experience
* Easier context selection, such as allowing readers to select chapters via natural language or a table of contents
* For fiction, interactive elements like family trees for character relationships or timelines for key plot events. Nonetheless, this will require more care to ensure faithfulness with the book, and to prevent hallucinations and spoilers.

If you’ve tried AI Reading Club, I’d love your feedback and feature ideas, and thoughts on how AI can help you get more out of reading. Please comment below or [DM me](https://x.com/eugeneyan)!
