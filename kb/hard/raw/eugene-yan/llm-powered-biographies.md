Inspired by Linus’ [tweet](https://twitter.com/thesephist/status/1636864930325442561) and out of curiosity, I asked some LLMs to write a biography of me. It seemed like a fun way to learn what these large language models (LLMs) are trained on and how they perform. Here are the results from `gpt-4`, `claude-v1.2`, `cohere-xlarge`, etc. While they’re not perfect, how each model improves over the previous is apparent. Also, it’s intriguing how some models memorize and regurgitate more than others.

```
Prompt: Please write me a detailed biography of Eugene Yan, who goes by @eugeneyan.
```

Overall, gpt3.5/4 performed the best—they got the gist right though erred on the details. The [Blurry JPEG](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web) analogy may be helpful in gaining more intuition on why this happens.

Note: These LLMs [can’t access the internet](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/10/chatgpt-internet-access/) so this is based on their training data.

## gpt-4 (2023-03-20)

Slightly better than GPT-3.5 though still many factual errors.

* Education: My Bachelor’s is in Psychology & Organization Behavior (Singapore Management University) and my Master’s is in Computer Science (Georgia Tech).
* Career: Only the first 2 roles are correct. The rest are wrong.

The overall theme seems correct, though it got many details wrong, including:

* Entrepreneur: Not an entrepreneur (unless it’s predicting the future?!)
* Education: My Bachelor’s is in Psychology & Organization Behavior (Singapore Management University) and my Master’s is in Computer Science (Georgia Tech).
* Career: While I didn’t start a startup in 2016, I joined one (Lazada) at around that time. It did eventually get acquired by Alibaba. Have never worked for Google.
* The rest: Flattering though somewhat exaggerated.
