## Overview

* Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) is a fundamental concept in annotation-driven research areas such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), computer vision, medical coding, and social sciences. The goal of IAA is to quantify the degree to which multiple annotators, given the same task and guidelines, produce consistent outputs.
* High agreement suggests that the task is well-defined and that the annotations can be trusted as ground truth; low agreement often indicates ambiguity in the task or poor annotator guideline design.

### Why Measure Inter-Annotator Agreement?

* **Reliability of Data**: Annotation tasks often serve as the foundation for training and evaluating supervised machine learning models. If annotations are unreliable, models trained on them will inherit that noise.
* **Task Clarity**: Low agreement can highlight that annotation guidelines are ambiguous, incomplete, or too subjective.
* **Annotator Quality**: Agreement measures can help detect inconsistent annotators or biases.
* **Scientific Rigor**: In empirical research, IAA serves as evidence that reported findings are reproducible and not merely artifacts of annotator idiosyncrasies.

### Types of Data for Agreement

* Different label/annotation data types call for different agreement metrics:

  + **Categorical/Semantic Labels (Nominal Data)**:
    - **Examples:** sentiment classification (positive/neutral/negative), medical diagnosis codes.
    - Agreement here involves checking whether annotators choose the same category.
  + **Ordinal Labels**:
    - **Examples:** rating scales (1–5 stars, severity levels).
    - Agreement must respect the fact that categories have an inherent order.
  + **Continuous Labels**:
    - **Examples:** bounding box coordinates in images, reaction times, or scores between 0 and 1.
    - Agreement is often measured via correlation or distance metrics.
  + **Structured Outputs**:
    - **Examples:** parse trees, dialogue act sequences, or entity spans.
    - Agreement requires specialized metrics that account for structured predictions.
  + **Distributions**:
    - In some tasks, annotators are asked not to provide a single label, but a **probability distribution** over possible labels. This reflects uncertainty or subjectivity.
    - Example: In emotion annotation, one annotator may assign 0.6 probability to “joy,” 0.3 to “surprise,” and 0.1 to “neutral,” while another annotator may spread probabilities differently.
    - Agreement is then measured using distributional divergences such as **Total Variation distance (TV distance)**, **Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL)**, or **Jensen–Shannon divergence (JS)**:
    - For two discrete distributions \(P\) and \(Q\) over a label space \(\mathcal{X}\):

      * **TV distance:**

        \[d\_{TV}(P, Q) = \frac{1}{2} \sum\_{x \in \mathcal{X}} | P(x) - Q(x) |\]
      * **KL divergence:**

        \[D\_{KL}(P \Vert Q) = \sum\_{x \in \mathcal{X}} P(x) \log \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\]
      * **JS divergence:**

        \[D\_{JS}(P \Vert Q) = \frac{1}{2} D\_{KL}\left(P \Vert M\right) + \frac{1}{2} D\_{KL}\left(Q \Vert M\right), \quad M = \frac{1}{2}(P + Q)\]
    - These measures provide a **graded notion of disagreement** rather than a binary match/mismatch.

## Classical Metrics for Inter-Annotator Agreement

* Classical agreement metrics focus on categorical and ordinal labels, where the annotators assign one label per instance. They adjust for chance agreement and provide interpretable scales of reliability.

### Cohen’s Kappa (\(\kappa\))

* **Definition**: For two annotators, Cohen’s kappa measures agreement while correcting for chance.
* **Formula**:

  + Let:

    - \(p\_o\): observed proportion agreement
    - \(p\_e\): expected agreement under independence
  + Then:

    \[\kappa = \frac{p\_o - p\_e}{1 - p\_e}\]
* **Suitable for**: Categorical (nominal) labels.
* **Use-case**: Two medical experts diagnosing patients into disease categories (yes/no cancer).
* **Pros**:

  + Corrects for chance agreement.
  + Easy to interpret (\(\kappa = 1\): perfect agreement, \(\kappa = 0\): chance-level).
* **Cons**:

  + Only supports two annotators.
  + Sensitive to class imbalance (rare categories can distort \(\kappa\)).

### Scott’s Pi (\(\pi\))

* **Definition**: Similar to Cohen’s \(\kappa\) but uses **expected agreement under uniform distribution** rather than empirical marginals.
* **Formula**:

  \[\pi = \frac{p\_o - p\_e}{1 - p\_e}\]
* **Suitable for**: Categorical data, two annotators.
* **Use-case**: Two coders labeling political statements as left/right/neutral.
* **Pros**:

  + Simple and interpretable.
  + Historically important precursor to \(\kappa\).
* **Cons**:

  + Assumes annotators share the same distribution.
  + Less robust in practice than \(\kappa\).

### Fleiss’ Kappa (\(\kappa\))

* **Definition**: Generalization of Cohen’s kappa for **more than two annotators**. Agreement is measured by comparing observed vs. expected proportions across all annotators.
* **Formula**:

  + For category \(j\):

    \[P\_j = \frac{1}{Nn} \sum\_{i=1}^N n\_{ij}\]
    - where \(n\_{ij}\) is the number of annotators assigning category \(j\) to item \(i\).
  + Then compute per-item agreement and average across items.
* **Suitable for**: Categorical (nominal) labels with multiple annotators.
* **Use-case**: A crowd-sourced sentiment task with 10 annotators per review.
* **Pros**:

  + Extends Cohen’s \(\kappa\) to many annotators.
  + Still adjusts for chance agreement.
* **Cons**:

  + Assumes annotators are exchangeable.
  + Same sensitivity to imbalance issues as Cohen’s \(\kappa\).

### Krippendorff’s Alpha (\(\alpha\))

* **Definition**: A versatile reliability coefficient that generalizes across data types.
* **Formula**:

  \[\alpha = 1 - \frac{D\_o}{D\_e}\]
  + where:

    - \(D\_o\) = observed disagreement
    - \(D\_e\) = expected disagreement
  + The definition of disagreement depends on the data type.
* **Suitable for**: Categorical (nominal), ordinal, interval, and ratio data; for continuous (interval or ratio data) measurements, disagreement is computed using squared numerical differences so agreement reflects closeness of values rather than exact equality.
* **Use-case**: Annotators rating severity of patient symptoms on a 1–5 scale.
* **Pros**:

  + Works with any number of annotators.
  + Can handle missing data.
  + Supports various data types beyond categorical.
* **Cons**:

  + Computationally heavier than \(\kappa\).
  + Requires defining distance functions for non-categorical data.

### Correlation-Based Measures

* Unlike classical IAA metrics such as **Cohen’s \(\kappa\)**, **Scott’s \(\pi\)**, **Fleiss’ \(\kappa\)**, and **Krippendorff’s \(\alpha\)**, correlation-based measures (e.g., **MCC**) do not explicitly model expected agreement under a chance or independence assumption. Instead, they quantify association or balance in outcomes based on observed label co-occurrences.
* Correlation-based measures frame agreement through the structure of the confusion matrix (e.g., \(TP, TN, FP, FN\) in MCC), emphasizing symmetric treatment of classes and errors, whereas classical metrics conceptualize agreement as a form of inter-annotator reliability corrected for chance labeling behavior.
* Classical metrics are designed to estimate annotator reliability across items and annotators, often supporting multiple annotators and label types, while correlation-based measures like **MCC** are narrower in scope—typically limited to two annotators and binary labels—and are better interpreted as measures of balanced association rather than general-purpose IAA coefficients.

#### Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)

* **Definition**: Matthews Correlation Coefficient is a correlation-based measure of agreement for binary categorical annotations. In the context of inter-annotator agreement, it compares two annotators’ binary labelings using the full confusion matrix, treating agreement and disagreement symmetrically across both classes.
* **Formula**:
  + Let \(TP\), \(TN\), \(FP\), and \(FN\) denote the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives between two annotators. MCC is defined as:\[\mathrm{MCC} = \frac{TP \cdot TN - FP \cdot FN}{\sqrt{(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP)(TN + FN)}}\]
* **Range and interpretation**:
  + \(\mathrm{MCC} \in [-1, 1]\), where 1 indicates perfect agreement, 0 corresponds to chance-level agreement for the observed marginals, and -1 indicates perfectly inverse labeling.
* **Suitable for**: Binary categorical annotations, especially under class imbalance.
* **Use-case**: Two annotators labeling instances as positive vs. negative (e.g., toxic vs. non-toxic, disease present vs. absent).
* **Pros**:

  + Uses all four entries of the confusion matrix.
  + Remains informative under severe class imbalance.
  + Symmetric with respect to the two annotators.
* **Cons**:

  + Limited to binary labels.
  + Undefined when one annotator uses only a single class (degenerate marginals).

### Comparative Analysis

| Metric | Data Type | Use-case Example | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cohen’s \({\kappa}\) | Categorical (2 annotators) | 2 doctors diagnosing disease | Adjusts for chance, easy to interpret | Only 2 annotators, sensitive to class imbalance |
| Scott’s \({\pi}\) | Categorical (2 annotators) | Political statement coding | Simple, historically important | Unrealistic distributional assumptions |
| Fleiss’ \({\kappa}\) | Categorical (many annotators) | Crowd sentiment annotation | Multi-annotator extension of Cohen’s $${\kappa}$$ | Assumes annotator interchangeability |
| Krippendorff’s \({\alpha}\) | Categorical, ordinal, continuous (interval or ratio) | Symptom severity ratings | Versatile, supports missing data | More complex computation |
| Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) | Binary categorical | Toxic vs. non-toxic labeling | Robust to class imbalance, uses full confusion matrix | Binary only; undefined for degenerate marginals |

## Why Classical Metrics Fall Short for Distributional Annotations

* Most classical inter-annotator agreement (IAA) metrics—such as **Cohen’s \(\kappa\)**, **Scott’s \(\pi\)**, **Fleiss’ \(\kappa\)**, and **Krippendorff’s \(\alpha\)**—as well as correlation-based measures like the **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)**, are designed under the assumption that annotators provide a **single discrete label** per item. Under this paradigm, annotations are treated as categorical outcomes, and agreement is defined in terms of exact label matches corrected for chance.
* However, this assumption increasingly fails in modern annotation settings, where labels are often **uncertain, subjective, or inherently graded**. In such cases, forcing annotators (or aggregated annotator behavior) to commit to a single label obscures meaningful information about ambiguity and disagreement.

### Emergence of Distributional Annotations

* With tasks involving **uncertainty, subjectivity, or ambiguity**, annotators are increasingly asked to provide a **distribution over labels** rather than a hard decision. For example:

  + **Emotion annotation**: Annotators distribute probabilities across emotions (e.g., joy, sadness, fear).
  + **Topic labeling**: A document may be annotated as 70% politics and 30% economics.
  + **Crowdsourcing**: Aggregating responses from many annotators naturally yields **empirical label distributions** rather than a single consensus label.
* Formally, these annotations lie in the probability simplex
  \(\Delta^K = \left{ p \in \mathbb{R}^K ;\middle|; p\_i \ge 0,; \sum\_{i=1}^K p\_i = 1 \right},\)
  rather than in a finite set of categorical labels. This provides a **richer representation of annotator uncertainty and disagreement**.

### Limitations of Classical Agreement Metrics

* **Binary versus graded disagreement**:

  + Metrics such as **Cohen’s \(\kappa\)** and **MCC** treat disagreement as all-or-nothing. Two annotators whose label distributions overlap substantially are treated the same as annotators whose judgments are completely opposed.
* **Information loss through discretization**:

  + Collapsing distributions to single labels (e.g., via \(\arg\max\)) discards uncertainty information and masks subtle but systematic differences between annotators.
* **Incompatibility with probabilistic structure**:

  + Classical agreement metrics assume categorical variables, not vectors constrained to the probability simplex \(\Delta^K\). As a result, they cannot operate directly on probabilistic annotations without ad hoc preprocessing.
* Because of these limitations, applying classical IAA metrics to distributional data often yields misleading or impoverished assessments of agreement.

### Correlation-Based Measures as Partial Workarounds

* **Correlation-based measures** such as **Pearson’s correlation coefficient**, **Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient**, and the **Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC)** are sometimes used when annotations are continuous or graded.
* These measures can be applied to distributional annotations only **indirectly**, by embedding each distribution into a continuous representation—for example, via expected label values or class-wise probability vectors.
* While such measures can capture **linear or monotonic association**, they do not operate on distributions as distributions. In particular, they ignore the geometry of the probability simplex and fail to provide a principled notion of distance between probability mass assignments.
* As a result, correlation-based measures should be viewed as **association metrics on derived quantities**, not true distributional agreement measures.

#### Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient (\(r\))

* **Definition**: Pearson’s correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two sets of continuous annotations. In inter-annotator agreement, it captures whether annotators vary together in a linear fashion, regardless of absolute scale alignment.
* **Formula**:

  \[r = \frac{\sum\_i (x\_i - \bar{x})(y\_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum\_i (x\_i - \bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum\_i (y\_i - \bar{y})^2}}\]
* **Range and interpretation**: \(r \in [-1, 1]\), where 1 indicates perfect positive linear association, 0 no linear association, and -1 perfect negative linear association.
* **Suitable for**: Interval or ratio-scale continuous annotations.
* **Use-case**: Two annotators assigning real-valued emotion intensity scores or regression-style labels.
* **Pros**:

  + Simple and widely understood.
  + Works naturally with continuous-valued data.
  + Interpretable as linear association strength.
* **Cons**:

  + Does not measure agreement in absolute values (only association).
  + Insensitive to systematic bias in mean or scale.
  + Sensitive to outliers.

#### Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient (\(\rho\))

* **Definition**: Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of a monotonic relationship between two sets of annotations. It operates on the ranks of the values rather than the raw values, making it suitable when only the ordering of annotations matters.
* **Formula**:
  + Let \(R(x\_i)\) and \(R(y\_i)\) denote the ranks of \(x\_i\) and \(y\_i\). Spearman’s \(\rho\) is defined as Pearson’s correlation applied to the ranks:\[\rho = \frac{\sum\_i (R(x\_i) - \overline{R(x)})(R(y\_i) - \overline{R(y)})}{\sqrt{\sum\_i (R(x\_i) - \overline{R(x)})^2}\sqrt{\sum\_i (R(y\_i) - \overline{R(y)})^2}}\]
  + For the special case of no tied ranks, this simplifies to:

    \[\rho = 1 - \frac{6\sum\_i d\_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}\]
    - where \(d\_i\) is the difference between ranks.
* **Range and interpretation**: \(\rho \in [-1, 1]\), with interpretations analogous to Pearson’s \(r\), but in terms of monotonic rather than strictly linear relationships.
* **Suitable for**: Ordinal data, continuous data where only relative ordering is meaningful.
* **Use-case**: Annotators ranking items by sentiment strength or perceived relevance.
* **Pros**:

  + Robust to monotonic nonlinear relationships.
  + Less sensitive to outliers than Pearson’s \(r\).
  + Appropriate for ordinal scales.
* **Cons**:

  + Ignores absolute differences between annotation values.
  + Still measures association, not absolute agreement.

#### Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC)

* **Definition**: The Concordance Correlation Coefficient measures agreement between two sets of continuous annotations by jointly assessing precision and accuracy. It extends Pearson’s correlation by penalizing systematic differences in location (mean) and scale (variance), thereby measuring how closely the annotators’ scores align with the identity line \(y = x\).
* **Formula**:
  + Let \(x\_i\) and \(y\_i\) denote the annotations from two annotators, with means \(\mu\_x, \mu\_y\), variances \(\sigma\_x^2, \sigma\_y^2\), and covariance \(\sigma\_{xy}\). CCC is defined as:\[\rho\_c = \frac{2\sigma\_{xy}}{\sigma\_x^2 + \sigma\_y^2 + (\mu\_x - \mu\_y)^2}\]
  + Equivalently, CCC can be written as:

    \[\rho\_c = \rho \cdot C\_b\]
    - where \(\rho\) is Pearson’s correlation coefficient and \(C\_b\) is a bias correction factor capturing differences in mean and scale.
* **Range and interpretation**:
  + \(\rho\_c \in [-1, 1]\), where 1 indicates perfect agreement (identical values), 0 indicates no agreement, and -1 indicates perfect inverse agreement.
* **Suitable for**: Continuous interval or ratio-scale annotations where absolute agreement matters.
* **Use-case**: Annotators assigning continuous scores such as emotion intensity, medical measurements, or regression targets.
* **Pros**:

  + Measures agreement rather than mere association.
  + Penalizes systematic bias between annotators.
  + More appropriate than Pearson’s \(r\) when scale alignment matters.
* **Cons**:

  + Typically defined for two annotators (multi-annotator use requires pairwise aggregation).
  + Sensitive to outliers, similar to Pearson’s correlation.

#### When Correlation-Based Measures Are Still Appropriate

* **Correlation-based measures**—including **Pearson’s \(r\)**, **Spearman’s \(\rho\)**, and **CCC**—can still play a useful role as **secondary analyses** alongside distributional divergences, provided their limitations are clearly understood.
* These measures are appropriate when **distributional annotations are reduced to continuous summaries**, such as:

  + Expected label values (e.g., \(\mathbb{E}[y] = \sum\_k k p\_k\) for ordinal labels),
  + Aggregate intensity scores,
  + Class-wise probability vectors analyzed dimension by dimension.
* In such cases:

  + **Pearson’s \(r\)** is useful for assessing whether annotators’ derived scores vary together linearly, even if they differ in scale.
  + **Spearman’s \(\rho\)** is appropriate when only relative ordering matters, such as ranking items by perceived intensity or relevance.
  + **CCC** is preferred when **absolute agreement** on continuous-valued summaries is important and systematic bias should be penalized.
* However, correlation-based measures should not be interpreted as **distributional agreement metrics**. They do not operate on probability distributions directly, ignore the geometry of the probability simplex, and can obscure meaningful differences in probability mass allocation.
* Best practice is therefore to use **distributional divergences** (e.g., TV, KL, JS) as the primary measures of agreement, with **correlation-based metrics** serving as complementary diagnostics on derived continuous representations.

If you want, the next step could be a brief unifying guideline section on choosing between divergence-based and correlation-based agreement metrics depending on annotation design.

### Transition to Divergence-Based Measures

* Rather than measuring categorical agreement or scalar association, distributional approaches quantify agreement by computing **distances or divergences between probability distributions**.
* These measures allow us to assess not only whether annotators disagree, but **how far apart their probability judgments are**.
* This motivates the use of **distributional agreement metrics** such as:

  + **Total Variation (TV) distance**
  + **Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence**
  + **Jensen–Shannon (JS) divergence**

### Distributional Agreement Metrics

* When annotators provide **probability distributions** instead of single labels, agreement must be measured by comparing two distributions directly. Metrics designed for this purpose are typically referred to as **distances** or **divergences** on the probability simplex.
* Unlike classical or correlation-based measures, these metrics operate natively on distributions \(P, Q \in \Delta^K\), preserving information about **uncertainty, partial agreement, and graded disagreement**.
* Distributional agreement metrics answer questions such as:

  + How much probability mass do two annotators assign differently?
  + How costly is it, in information-theoretic terms, to approximate one annotator’s beliefs with another’s?
  + Are two distributions close in a symmetric and bounded sense?
* Below, we describe three widely used distributional agreement metrics—**Total Variation distance**, **Kullback–Leibler divergence**, and **Jensen–Shannon divergence**—each of which captures a different notion of disagreement between probability distributions.

#### Total Variation (TV) Distance

* **Definition**: For two discrete distributions \(P\) and \(Q\) over a label set \(\mathcal{X}\), the **Total Variation distance** quantifies the largest possible difference between the probabilities assigned by \(P\) and \(Q\) to the same event. Intuitively, it measures how much probability mass must be reallocated to transform one distribution into the other.
* **Formula**:

  \[d\_{TV}(P, Q) = \frac{1}{2} \sum\_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \left| P(x) - Q(x) \right|\]
* **Intuition**: TV distance measures the maximum absolute discrepancy in probability mass across categories. It can be interpreted as the largest possible difference in probability that the two annotators assign to the same outcome.
* **Range**: \([0, 1]\)

  + \(0\) indicates identical distributions.
  + \(1\) indicates completely disjoint support.
* **Suitable for**: Any form of distributional annotation, regardless of label semantics.
* **Use-case**: Comparing how two annotators distribute probability mass across emotions for a sentence.
* **Pros**:

  + **Symmetric** and **bounded**.
  + A true **metric** (satisfies the triangle inequality).
  + Highly **interpretable**.
* **Cons**:

  + Ignores information-theoretic structure.
  + Can be relatively coarse in high-dimensional label spaces.

#### Kullback–Leibler (KL) Divergence

* **Definition**: The **Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence** quantifies how one probability distribution \(Q\) diverges from another distribution \(P\). It measures the expected number of extra bits required to encode samples drawn from \(P\) using a code optimized for \(Q\). KL divergence is rooted in information theory and is inherently **asymmetric**.
* **Formula**:

  \[D\_{KL}(P \Vert Q) = \sum\_{x \in \mathcal{X}} P(x) \log \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\]
* **Intuition**: KL divergence measures the inefficiency incurred when \(Q\) is used as a surrogate for \(P\). Large values indicate that \(Q\) assigns low probability to events that \(P\) considers likely.
* **Range**: \([0, \infty)\)

  + \(0\) if and only if \(P = Q\).
* **Suitable for**: Distributional annotations where one distribution can be treated as a reference or target and the other as an approximation.
* **Use-case**: Quantifying how much information is lost if one annotator’s probability distribution is used to approximate another’s.
* **Pros**:

  + Strong **information-theoretic interpretation**.
  + Highly sensitive to discrepancies in **low-probability events**.
* **Cons**:

  + **Asymmetric**: \(D\_{KL}(P \Vert Q) \neq D\_{KL}(Q \Vert P)\).
  + **Undefined** when \(Q(x) = 0\) and \(P(x) > 0\).
  + Unbounded and often **hard to interpret numerically**.

#### Jensen–Shannon (JS) Divergence

* **Definition**: The **Jensen–Shannon (JS) divergence** is a symmetrized and smoothed variant of the KL divergence. It measures how much each of two distributions diverges, on average, from their mean distribution. Unlike KL divergence, JS divergence is always finite and symmetric.
* Let the mean distribution be:

  \[M = \frac{1}{2}(P + Q).\]
* **Formula**:

  \[D\_{JS}(P \Vert Q) = \frac{1}{2} D\_{KL}(P \Vert M) + \frac{1}{2} D\_{KL}(Q \Vert M).\]
* **Intuition**: JS divergence captures the average information loss when both distributions are approximated by their midpoint. It balances sensitivity to differences with numerical stability.
* **Range**: \([0, \log 2]\)

  + Often normalized to \([0, 1]\) for convenience.
  + \(0\) indicates identical distributions.
* **Suitable for**: Any pair of probability distributions, especially when **symmetry and stability** are desired.
* **Use-case**: Comparing how two annotators spread probability mass across multiple labels while avoiding undefined or infinite values.
* **Pros**:

  + **Symmetric** and **always finite**.
  + The square root \(\sqrt{D\_{JS}}\) defines a true **metric**.
  + More **robust in practice** than KL divergence.
* **Cons**:

  + Less directly interpretable than Total Variation distance.
  + Still sensitive to smoothing and normalization choices.

### Comparative Analysis

## Practical Considerations for Inter-Annotator Agreement

* IAA analysis requires more than just selecting a formula — it involves understanding the **data type, annotation context, and interpretability needs**. This section provides guidance on how to choose metrics, what to watch out for, and how to interpret agreement scores.

| Categorical (nominal) | Cohen’s \(\kappa\) (2 annotators), Fleiss’ \(\kappa\) (many), Krippendorff’s \(\alpha\) | Must check for class imbalance effects |
| Ordinal | Weighted Cohen’s \(\kappa\), Krippendorff’s \(\alpha\), Spearman’s \(\rho\) | Use distance-based weighting to respect ordering |
| Continuous | Pearson’s \(r\), Intraclass Correlation (ICC), Krippendorff’s \(\alpha\) | Handle outliers carefully, scale-sensitive |
| Structured outputs | Task-specific metrics (e.g., overlap F1, span-based agreement) | Define what counts as “match” structurally |
| Distributions | TV distance, JS divergence, KL divergence | Do not collapse to argmax labels; keep full distributions |

* **Rule of thumb**:

  + If annotators give single discrete labels \(\rightarrow\) use chance-corrected categorical metrics.
  + If annotators give scores or ranks \(\rightarrow\) use correlation- or distance-based measures.
  + If annotators give full probability distributions \(\rightarrow\) use divergence measures.

### Interpreting Agreement Levels

* There is no absolute scale, but a commonly used heuristic (adapted from [Landis & Koch, 1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa#Interpretation) interpretation for Cohen’s \(\kappa\)) is:

| **Agreement value** | **Interpretation** |
| --- | --- |
| \(< 0.0\) | Worse than chance |
| \(0.0–0.20\) | Slight agreement |
| \(0.21–0.40\) | Fair agreement |
| \(0.41–0.60\) | Moderate agreement |
| \(0.61–0.80\) | Substantial agreement |
| \(0.81–1.00\) | Almost perfect |

* For **divergence metrics** (TV, KL, JS), lower values mean closer distributions. Typical observed ranges:

  + **TV distance:** < 0.1 \(\rightarrow\) very similar; > 0.3 \(\rightarrow\) strong disagreement
  + **JS divergence:** < 0.05 \(\rightarrow\) close; > 0.2 \(\rightarrow\) widely different
  + **KL divergence:** highly variable; compare relative changes, not absolute cutoffs.

### Handling Annotator Bias and Class Imbalance

* **Class imbalance** can inflate or deflate \(\kappa\)-like metrics. Consider reporting class distributions alongside agreement.
* **Annotator bias** (systematic skew) can lower \(\kappa\) even if raw agreement is high.
* Consider using **confusion matrices** to inspect which categories cause disagreement.

### Missing Data and Sparse Annotations

* **Krippendorff’s \(\alpha\)** is robust to missing annotations and is the safest choice for incomplete data.
* For divergence-based measures, ensure smoothing (e.g., add small \(\epsilon\)) to avoid zeros that break KL.

### Computational Considerations

* **\(\kappa\)-type metrics** are computationally cheap (matrix counts).
* **Krippendorff’s \(\alpha\)** is \(O(N \times A^2)\) for \(N\) items and \(A\) annotators — still feasible but heavier.
* **Divergence-based metrics** are \(O(K)\) per pair of distributions, where \(K\) is the number of categories.
* If annotator sets are large, prefer efficient **pairwise sampling** strategies or **aggregate distributions**.

## Mathematical Relationships Between TV, KL, and JS

* While **Total Variation Distance**, **Kullback–Leibler divergence**, and **Jensen–Shannon divergence** measure different aspects of distributional difference, they are connected through known inequalities. Understanding these links helps interpret and compare their values meaningfully.

### Pinsker’s Inequality (KL vs. TV)

* Pinsker’s inequality provides an upper bound on TV distance in terms of KL divergence:

\[d\_{TV}(P, Q) \le \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} D\_{KL}(P \Vert Q)}\]

* This means:

  + If KL divergence is small, then TV must also be small.
  + Small KL implies distributions are close in absolute terms.
  + However, small TV does **not** guarantee small KL (KL can blow up when \(Q(x) \approx 0\)).

**Implication**:

* KL is more sensitive to low-probability mismatches than TV.

### Lower Bound on KL via TV

* A lesser-known inequality gives a lower bound on KL in terms of TV:

\[D\_{KL}(P \Vert Q) \ge 2 d\_{TV}^2(P, Q)\]

* This shows that large TV implies large KL. Together with Pinsker’s inequality, this pins down their growth relationship:

\[2 d\_{TV}^2(P,Q) \le D\_{KL}(P \Vert Q)\]

### JS Divergence Related to KL and TV

* JS divergence is defined as:

  \[D\_{JS}(P|Q) = \frac{1}{2}D\_{KL}(P \Vert M) + \frac{1}{2}D\_{KL}(Q \Vert M), \quad M = \frac{1}{2}(P+Q)\]
  + and satisfies:\[D\_{JS}(P \Vert Q) \le \log 2\]
* It inherits KL’s information-theoretic basis while being symmetric and bounded.
* Also, it relates to TV as:

\[d\_{TV}^2(P,Q) \le \frac{1}{2} D\_{JS}(P \Vert Q)\]

* So:

  + JS grows at least as fast as \(d\_{TV}^2\).
  + JS is upper-bounded, while KL is unbounded.
  + JS is often preferred for **interpretability and numerical stability**.

### Comparative Analysis of Theoretical Relationships

| **Pair** | **Inequality** | **Interpretation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TV vs. KL | \(d\_{TV} \le \sqrt{\tfrac{1}{2} D\_{KL}}\) | Small KL implies small TV |
| TV vs. KL | \(2 d\_{TV}^2 \le D\_{KL}\) | Large TV implies large KL |
| TV vs. JS | \(d\_{TV}^2 \le \tfrac{1}{2} D\_{JS}\) | JS lower bounds TV squared |
| JS vs. KL | \(D\_{JS} \le D\_{KL} \quad \text{(if } P=Q \text{ support)}\) | JS is smoothed and bounded version of KL |

* **Key takeaways**:

  + TV gives an absolute probability difference.
  + KL gives a relative (log-based) penalty, very sensitive to rare events.
  + JS sits between them: symmetric, smoothed, and bounded, making it ideal for **practical agreement comparisons**.

## Putting It All Together: A Workflow for Measuring IAA

* This section provides a **step-by-step pipeline** for measuring inter-annotator agreement, choosing the correct metric, and interpreting the results in context.

### Step 1: Identify Annotation Data Type

* Before picking any metric, classify your annotation outputs into one of these types:

  + **Categorical (nominal):** single class per item, no order
  + **Ordinal:** discrete ranks with meaningful order
  + **Continuous:** numeric values on a scale (say, interval or ratio data)
  + **Structured:** spans, trees, sequences
  + **Distributions:** full probability vectors over categories
* **Tip**: If annotators are uncertain and spread probability mass, treat their outputs as distributions rather than forcing hard labels.
  Here is the **updated version** with **Scott’s \(\pi\)**, **MCC**, and **Total Variation distance** added in a principled way, while keeping the same formatting and scope.

---

### Step 2: Choose Suitable Metrics

* Use this quick mapping:

| **Data Type** | **Recommended Metrics** |
| --- | --- |
| Categorical | Cohen’s \(\kappa\) (2), Scott’s \(\pi\) (2), Fleiss’ \(\kappa\) (many), Krippendorff’s \(\alpha\), Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC, binary) |
| Ordinal | Weighted Cohen’s \(\kappa\), Krippendorff’s \(\alpha\), Spearman’s \(\rho\) |
| Continuous | Pearson’s \(r\), Intraclass Correlation (ICC), Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC), Krippendorff’s \(\alpha\) |
| Structured | Task-specific matching (span F1, overlap measures) |
| Distributions | Total Variation distance (\(d\_{TV}\)), Kullback–Leibler divergence (\(D\_{KL}\)), Jensen–Shannon divergence (\(D\_{JS}\)), Earth Mover’s Distance (\(EMD\)) |

* **Guidelines**:

  + If you care primarily about **agreement beyond chance**, use \(\kappa\)-type metrics (including Scott’s \(\pi\) and Krippendorff’s \(\alpha\)).
  + If labels are **binary and imbalanced**, consider **MCC** as a complementary association-based diagnostic.
  + If you care about **numerical closeness or uncertainty**, use **correlation-based measures** (for continuous summaries) or **distributional divergences** (for probability distributions).

### Step 3: Compute Agreement

* Clean data: handle missing annotations, standardize label sets.
* For categorical metrics, build an item × annotator label matrix.
* For distributional metrics, build an item × annotator probability matrix.
* Compute:

  + Pairwise agreement (between annotator pairs)
  + Average agreement (overall reliability)
* **Tip**: For large numbers of annotators, use random subsampling of pairs to reduce computation.

### Step 4: Interpret Scores in Context

* Compare against known benchmarks (e.g., \(\kappa\) > 0.6 is substantial agreement).
* For divergence metrics:

  + \(d\_{TV} < 0.1\) or \(D\_{JS} < 0.05\) \(\rightarrow\) very high agreement
  + \(d\_{TV} > 0.3\) or \(D\_{JS} > 0.2\) \(\rightarrow\) strong disagreement
* Visualize distributions and confusion matrices to identify where disagreements occur.
* **Important**: Absolute cutoffs are less meaningful than **relative comparisons across tasks or iterations**.

### Step 5: Act on the Results

* If agreement is low:

  + Refine annotation guidelines
  + Provide more training/examples to annotators
  + Identify and retrain or remove inconsistent annotators
* If agreement is high:

  + Proceed with data aggregation and model training
  + Optionally, use annotator reliability as weights in aggregation

### Step 6: Report Transparently

* When publishing or sharing results:

  + Specify which metric you used and why.
  + Report number of annotators, number of samples, and how missing data was handled.
  + Include both agreement values and class distributions for context.

| JS divergence | Distributions | \(D\_{JS}(P|Q)=\tfrac{1}{2}D\_{KL}(P \Vert M)+\tfrac{1}{2}D\_{KL}(Q \Vert M),\) \(M=\tfrac{1}{2}(P+Q)\) | Smoothed, symmetric version of KL | Symmetric; bounded; interpretable | Still needs smoothing | \([0, \log 2]\); general probabilistic agreement |
| Task-specific overlap (\(F\_1\), span \(F\_1\)) | Structured outputs | \(F\_1=\frac{2PR}{P+R}\) | Overlap or matching agreement | Intuitive for structured data | Needs domain-specific definition | \([0, 1]\); entity extraction, segmentation |

### Takeaways

* **Symmetry**:
  TV and JS are symmetric; KL is not.
* **Boundedness**:
  \(d\_{TV} \in [0, 1], \quad D\_{JS} \in [0, \log 2], \quad D\_{KL} \in [0, \infty)\)
* **Data completeness**:
  Krippendorff’s \(\alpha\) handles missing data best.
* **When in doubt**:

  + For categorical labels \(\rightarrow\) Cohen/Fleiss \(\kappa\).
  + For continuous or ordinal \(\rightarrow\) correlation or \(\alpha\).
  + For distributions \(\rightarrow\) \(d\_{TV}\) or \(D\_{JS}\) divergence.
