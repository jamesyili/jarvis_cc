## Overview

* Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs) are evaluated across a wide array of benchmarks, which test their abilities in language understanding, reasoning, coding, and multimedia understanding (in case of VLMs).
* These benchmarks are crucial for the development of AI models as they provide standardized challenges that help identify both strengths and weaknesses, driving improvements in future iterations.
* This primer offers an overview of these benchmarks, attributes of their datasets, and relevant papers.

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

### General Benchmarks

#### Language Understanding

##### GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation)

* **Description:** A set of nine tasks including question answering and textual entailment, designed to gauge general language understanding.
* **Dataset Attributes:** Diverse text genres from web text, fiction, and non-fiction, requiring models to handle a variety of language styles and complexities. The tasks range from single-sentence tasks (e.g., CoLA for linguistic acceptability) to sentence-pair tasks (e.g., MRPC for paraphrase detection).
* **Reference:** [“GLUE: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding”](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJ4km2R5t7).

##### SuperGLUE

* **Description:** A more challenging version of GLUE intended to push language models to their limits.
* **Dataset Attributes:** Includes more complex reasoning tasks over multiple domains, emphasizing inference, logic, and common sense. Tasks include Boolean Question (BoolQ), CommitmentBank (CB) for textual entailment, and Winogender schemas (WSC) for pronoun resolution.
* **Reference:** [“SuperGLUE: A Stickier Benchmark for General-Purpose Language Understanding Systems”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00537).

##### MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)

* **Description:** Assesses model performance across a broad range of subjects and task formats to test general knowledge.
* **Dataset Attributes:** Covers 57 tasks across subjects like humanities, STEM, and social sciences, requiring broad and specialized knowledge. The tasks vary from multiple-choice questions to open-ended questions, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of linguistic intelligence.
* **Reference:** [“Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300).

##### MMLU-Pro (Massive Multitask Language Understanding Pro)

* **Description:** A robust and challenging dataset designed to rigorously benchmark large language models’ capabilities. With 12K complex questions across various disciplines, it enhances evaluation complexity and model robustness by increasing options from 4 to 10, making random guessing less effective. Unlike the original MMLU’s knowledge-driven questions, MMLU-Pro focuses on more difficult, reasoning-based problems, where chain-of-thought (CoT) results can be 20% higher than perplexity (PPL). This increased difficulty results in more consistent model performance, as seen with Llama-2-7B’s variance of within 1%, compared to 4-5% in the original MMLU.
* **Dataset Attributes:** 12K questions with 10 options each. Sources include Original MMLU, STEM websites, TheoremQA, and SciBench. Covers disciplines such as Math, Physics, Chemistry, Law, Engineering, Health, Psychology, Economics, Business, Biology, Philosophy, Computer Science, and History. Focus on reasoning, increased problem difficulty, and manual expert review by a panel of over ten experts.
