## Overview

* Machine Translation: task of translating a sentence \(x\) from one language to another.
* Before we have neural machine translation, around the time of the Cold War, we had code breaking.
  + 1920-2010: Statistical Machine Translation
  + Learn a probabilistic model from data
  + Large amount of parallel data human translated between difference languages

## Neural Machine Translation

* This is a way to do Machine Translation with single end to end neural network.
* How does it work?
  + Feed source sentence
  + Output translation
  + Feed a lot of parallel translation
  + Encode source sentence

## Seq2Seq

* Sequence-to-sequence models are deep learning models that have achieved a lot of success in tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning. Google Translate started using such a model in production in late 2016.
* A sequence-to-sequence model is a model that takes a sequence of items (words, letters, features of an images…etc) and outputs another sequence of items
* In neural machine translation, a sequence is a series of words, processed one after another. The output is, likewise, a series of words
* The encoder processes each item in the input sequence, it compiles the information it captures into a vector (called the context). After processing the entire input sequence, the encoder sends the context over to the decoder, which begins producing the output sequence item by item.
* The context is a vector (an array of numbers, basically) in the case of machine translation. The encoder and decoder tend to both be recurrent neural networks
* You can set the size of the context vector when you set up your model. It is basically the number of hidden units in the encoder RNN. These visualizations show a vector of size 4, but in real world applications the context vector would be of a size like 256, 512, or 1024.
* requires 2 Neural networks (RNN)
* Seq2Seq uses:
  + Summarization
  + Dialogue
  + Parsing
  + Code generation

## Training NMT

* Get a large parallel corpus
* Source sentence:batches will be encoded, feed final hidden state to target LSTM
* Compare word by word if sentence was correct otherwise take a loss (negative log probability)
* Loss gives us information to back prop through entire network
* Seq2Seq is optimized as a single system so you can update all parameters of decoder and encoder model
* Target sentences from decoder RNN

## Multi layer RNNs

* By design, a RNN takes two inputs at each time step: an input (in the case of the encoder, one word from the input sentence), and a hidden state
* Allows network to compute more complex representations
* Lower RNNs should computer lower level features and higher RNNs should compute higher level features
* Lower features: more basic things about words like what part of speech, are these words a name or a company
* Higher features: overall structure of sentence, positive or negative connotation, semantic meaning
* Has a `<START>` and `<END>` token

## Beam search decoding

* On each step of decoder, keep track of k most probable partial translations(which is called a hypothesis)
* K is the beam size(5-10)
* Used in more than just NMT
* Hypothesis has a score which is the log probability of what we’ve seen so far
* Not guaranteed to find optimal solution
* Longer hypotheses have lower scores:
  + Need to use normalization by length

## Evaluation for Machine Translation

* Get a translator to judge how good of a translation is
* Scoring translation: BLEU
  + You compare machine written translation to one or several human written translation and compute a similarity score

## Low Resource Machine Translation

* Parallel data set
* Minimize cross entropy loss
* Maximize log probability of the reference human translation given source sentence
  + Via stochastic gradient descent
* Supervised learning because parallel dataset available
* Algorithms:
  + Phrase-based and Neural Unsup Machine Translation
  + Back Translation (data augmentation?)
* Hyperparameter = noise
