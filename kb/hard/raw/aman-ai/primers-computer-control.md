## Overview

* With the ongoing advancements in AI, agents are becoming increasingly capable of interacting with computers in human-like ways. These multimodal (specifically, vision-language agents) are designed to automate tasks across different environments, from controlling entire desktop systems to handling browser-based workflows. Below is an overview of three prominent AI agents specializing in computer use: Anthropic’s “Computer Use,” OpenAI’s “Operator,” and “Manus.”

## [Anthropic’s Computer Use](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use)

* Anthropic’s “Computer Use” feature, which utilizes their Claude language model under-the-hood, enables the AI to interact with a computer’s desktop environment in a manner akin to human users. This functionality allows Claude to perform tasks such as moving the cursor, clicking buttons, and typing text, effectively executing complex, multi-step operations across various applications. For example, Claude can plan an outing by searching online and scheduling it on a calendar app, or build a simple promotional website by coding and testing it.

### Advantages

* **Comprehensive System Interaction:** Claude’s ability to control the entire desktop environment allows it to interact with multiple applications beyond just the browser, facilitating more integrated workflows.

### Limitations

* **Local Execution:** Since Claude operates directly on the user’s local machine, it may not yield control back to the user during task execution, potentially leading to usability concerns.

## [OpenAI’s Operator](https://openai.com/operator)

* OpenAI’s “Operator” is a browser-based AI agent designed to handle repetitive tasks such as filling out forms, ordering groceries, and even creating memes. Operator can be asked to handle a wide variety of repetitive browser tasks, performing actions like clicking, scrolling, or typing.

### Advantages

* **Cloud-Based Execution:** Operator runs in a virtual browser session in the cloud, allowing users to offload tasks without impacting local system resources.
* **Browser-Centric Tasks:** Optimized for web-based interactions, Operator excels in tasks confined to the browser environment, offering a streamlined experience for internet-related automation.

### Limitations

* **Restricted to Browser:** Operator’s functionality is limited to the browser and cannot interact with applications beyond it, potentially limiting its utility for tasks requiring broader system access.

## [Manus](https://manus.im/)

* Manus is a general AI agent developed by Monica.im, designed to bridge the gap between human thoughts and actions by autonomously executing tasks across various domains. Unlike traditional AI assistants that provide suggestions, Manus delivers complete results by performing tasks such as writing and executing code, browsing web pages, and operating applications within an independent virtual environment.

### Advantages

* **Autonomous Task Execution:** Manus can independently handle complex tasks, including report writing, data analysis, and content generation, reducing the need for constant human intervention.
* **Multi-Modal Capabilities:** Manus processes and generates various types of data, such as text, images, and code, making it versatile in handling diverse tasks.
* **Advanced Tool Integration:** The ability to interact with external applications, including web browsers and code editors, allows Manus to automate workflows effectively.

### Limitations

* **Limited to Browser/Terminal/Code:** Unlike Anthropic’s “Computer Use,” which can control the entire desktop, Manus is currently restricted to interacting within browser environments, command-line interfaces, and code execution, limiting its ability to manage full desktop applications../

## Comparative Analysis

* Each of these AI agents offers distinct features tailored to different user needs. The choice between these AI agents depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand—whether comprehensive system interaction is needed, browser-based automation suffices, or autonomous execution across various domains is desired.

  + **Scope of Interaction:** Anthropic’s Computer Use provides comprehensive system interaction by controlling the desktop environment, suitable for tasks involving multiple applications. OpenAI’s Operator focuses on browser-based tasks, offering a controlled and secure environment for web interactions. Manus combines these approaches by operating within an independent virtual environment, allowing it to perform a wide range of tasks autonomously.
  + **Execution Environment:** Computer Use operates locally, which may raise concerns about resource utilization and user control during task execution. Operator’s cloud-based approach mitigates these issues but confines its capabilities to the browser. Manus’s independent virtual environment offers a balance, enabling extensive task execution without directly impacting the user’s local system.
  + **Performance Benchmarks:** Manus has reportedly achieved state-of-the-art performance in AI benchmarks such as GAIA, outperforming models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Microsoft’s AI systems. This suggests a high level of proficiency in handling complex, real-world tasks.
