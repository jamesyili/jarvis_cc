## Overview

* This primer examines several tasks that can be effectively addressed using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Named Entity Recognition (NER)

* Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a crucial component of NLP that plays a vital role in information extraction and data - analysis. It focuses on identifying and categorizing named entities within text into predefined categories, which can significantly enhance the understanding and interpretation of large volumes of text.
* In other words, NER stands as a cornerstone in the realm of NLP, offering a pathway to transform unstructured text into structured, actionable data. Its ability to identify and categorize entities accurately opens doors to a myriad of applications across various industries, making it an indispensable tool in the age of information.
* Here is a detailed look at NER, including its process, applications, methodologies, and advancements.

### Definition and Purpose

* **Primary Goal**: NER aims to locate and classify named entities mentioned in text into specific categories such as names of individuals, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.
* **Importance in NLP**: As a fundamental task in NLP, NER helps in structuring and categorizing unstructured text, making it a critical component for tasks like data retrieval, analysis, and understanding.

### Process and Techniques

* NER operates in two stages: (i) detection of a named entity, followed by its (ii) categorization/classification. The following slide, sourced from the [Stanford CS224n course](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/), illustrates this:

* **Entity Identification**: The first step in NER is to identify a potential named entity within a body of text. This can be a single word or a sequence of words forming a name.
* **Classification**: Once an entity is identified, it’s classified into predefined categories like ‘Person’, ‘Organization’, ‘Location’, etc.
* **Contextual Analysis**: NER systems use the context around each identified entity for accurate classification. This involves analyzing the surrounding words and understanding the entity’s role within the sentence.
* **Word Vector Analysis**: Modern NER systems often use word vectors, representations of words in a multidimensional space, to capture semantic and syntactic meanings.

### Common Architectures and Models

* **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) with CRF**: BiLSTM processes text data in both forward and backward directions, capturing context more effectively. The Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer then uses this context to classify entities more accurately.
* **Transformer-based Models**: With the advent of Transformer models like BERT, NER systems have significantly improved. These models capture a deeper and more nuanced understanding of context, which is essential for accurate entity recognition and classification.

### Sub-types of NER

* **Fine-Grained NER**: This involves categorizing entities into more specific sub-categories, offering a more detailed analysis. For example, instead of just ‘Person’, it might classify entities as ‘Artist’, ‘Politician’, etc.
* **Cross-Lingual NER**: Identifies and categorizes named entities in multiple languages, crucial for global applications and multilingual data sets.
* **Real-Time NER**: Designed for immediate processing of text data, such as in live news feeds or social media streams.

### FAQs

#### What are the types of Question Answering systems?

* Question Answering (QA) systems come in various types, each designed to handle specific kinds of queries or data sources. Here’s a detailed look at five notable types: Closed-Book QA, Open-Book QA, Closed-Domain QA, Open-Domain QA, and Visual QA.

  1. **Closed-Book QA**:
     + **Description**: In Closed-Book QA, the system answers questions based on knowledge it has internalized during its training. It does not access any external information sources or databases while answering.
     + **Operation**: The system relies on what it has ‘learned’ and stored in its parameters through extensive training on a wide range of data.
     + **Applications**: Ideal for scenarios where quick, factual responses are needed, and the range of expected questions is within the scope of the model’s training.
     + **Limitations**: The accuracy and depth of answers are limited to the content and quality of its training data. It might not be current or comprehensive for all possible questions.
  2. **Open-Book QA**:
     + **Description**: Open-Book QA systems answer questions by referring to external data sources such as the internet, databases, or specific documents.
     + **Operation**: When posed with a question, these systems search for relevant information in external sources, process it, and then generate an answer.
     + **Applications**: Useful for questions requiring up-to-date information or topics that are too broad or current to be covered entirely in the training data.
     + **Limitations**: The effectiveness depends on the system’s ability to access, search, and understand relevant external information.
  3. **Closed-Domain QA**:
     + **Description**: This type of system specializes in answering questions within a specific field or domain, such as medicine, law, or a particular set of literature.
     + **Operation**: It is trained with domain-specific data, enabling it to understand and process queries relevant to that domain deeply.
     + **Applications**: Particularly useful in professional or academic fields where expertise in a specific subject matter is required.
     + **Limitations**: Its scope is limited to the predefined domain, and it may not perform well on questions outside of that domain.
  4. **Open-Domain QA**:
     + **Description**: Open-Domain QA systems are designed to answer questions across a wide range of topics, not limited to any specific subject area.
     + **Operation**: These systems are typically trained on a diverse set of data from various fields and may use both closed-book and open-book methods to generate answers.
     + **Applications**: Ideal for general-purpose question answering where the queries can span a wide array of subjects.
     + **Limitations**: While versatile, they might not have the depth of knowledge in specific areas compared to closed-domain systems.
  5. **Visual QA**:
     + **Description**: Visual QA involves answering questions based on visual content such as images or videos.
     + **Operation**: These systems analyze visual input, understand the context, and then answer questions related to that input.
     + **Applications**: Useful in scenarios where the query is about the content or context of a visual input, like identifying objects, actions, or explaining scenes in an image or video.
     + **Limitations**: The accuracy depends heavily on the system’s ability to interpret visual data correctly, which can be challenging due to the complexity and variability of visual content.
* Each of these QA systems has its unique strengths and is suited for different applications. The development and improvement of these systems are ongoing, driven by advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.

#### What is the difference between open- and closed-book QA?

* The difference between open-book and closed-book question answering (QA) lies primarily in how information is accessed and utilized to answer questions.
  1. **Closed-Book QA**: In closed-book qQA, the system answers questions based solely on information it has been pre-trained on. It doesn’t have access to external sources or databases during the answering process. The knowledge is, in a sense, “memorized” or encoded in the model’s parameters through its training data. This method requires the model to have a large and comprehensive training dataset so that it can cover a wide range of topics. The model’s ability to answer questions is limited to what it has been trained on. Closed-book QA, unlike open-book QA, does not typically involve providing a specific context or passage with the question. The system relies on its pre-trained knowledge to answer questions, without external text references. In this model, the answers are generated based on the information encoded in the system’s parameters, without the need for external text for reference.
  2. **Open-Book QA**: Open-book question answering, on the other hand, involves the system actively retrieving information from external sources or databases to answer questions. This can include looking up information on the internet, accessing specific databases, or referring to external documents. In this approach, a specific context or passage is provided along with the question. The system uses this context this external information in real-time to formulate an answer. The context can be a paragraph, a document, or a set of documents from which the system retrieves information relevant to the question. This approach is particularly useful for complex questions where the answer depends heavily on understanding and analyzing a given text, allowing the system to access the most current and detailed information available, even if it wasn’t included in its original training data.
* In summary, closed-book QA relies on a model’s internal knowledge gained during training, while open-book QA involves external information retrieval to supplement the model’s knowledge base. Open-book QA tends to be more dynamic and up-to-date, whereas closed-book QA depends heavily on the breadth and quality of the training data.

#### How are open-book and open-domain QA different?

* Open-book QA and open-domain QA are not the same, though they might sound similar. Each term refers to different aspects of question answering systems:

  1. **Open-Book QA**: Open-book question answering involves the use of external information sources to answer questions. In this approach, the system actively retrieves information from external documents, databases, or the internet to respond to queries. The focus is on the system’s ability to look up and synthesize information from outside its pre-trained knowledge base.
  2. **Open-Domain QA**: Open-domain question answering, on the other hand, refers to the system’s ability to answer questions across a wide range of topics or domains, without being restricted to a specific subject area. This can be achieved either through closed-book methods (where the model relies on its internal knowledge acquired during training) or open-book methods (where it looks up information externally). The key aspect of open-domain QA is its versatility and breadth in handling questions from various fields, be it science, history, popular culture, etc.
* In summary, open-book QA is about the source of the information (external resources), while open-domain QA is about the scope of the topics (broad and unrestricted). A question answering system can be both open-book and open-domain if it uses external resources to answer questions on a wide range of topics.
