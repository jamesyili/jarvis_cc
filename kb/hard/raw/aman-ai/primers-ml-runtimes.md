## Introduction

* As AI becomes increasingly integral to modern software applications, deploying models directly on devices—such as smartphones, embedded systems, wearables, and edge computing nodes—has gained prominence. This approach, known as **on-device machine learning**, enables faster inference, improved privacy, offline capabilities, and lower latency compared to cloud-based alternatives.
* Several runtimes/inference engines have been developed to facilitate the efficient execution of ML models on diverse hardware architectures. These runtimes vary significantly in terms of platform compatibility, supported model formats, execution optimizations, and hardware acceleration. This primer covers a detailed comparison of key ML runtimes that support on-device inference:

  + TensorRT
  + Core ML
  + MLX (Apple MLX)
  + ONNX Runtime
  + ExecuTorch
  + LidarTLM
  + `llama.cpp`
  + TensorFlow Lite / TensorFlow Serving
* This primer includes both general-purpose and specialized runtimes, ranging from Core ML and TensorFlow Lite to transformer-specific tools like `llama.cpp` and GPU-optimized engines such as TensorRT.

## Architecture Overview of On-Device ML Runtimes

* On-device machine learning runtimes are engineered to execute pre-trained models efficiently within the constraints of mobile devices, embedded platforms, and personal computers. Despite the diversity of runtimes, they typically share core architectural components that manage model parsing, hardware abstraction, and execution flow.
* This section outlines common architectural patterns and then provides architecture summaries for each runtime discussed in this primer.

### Common Architectural Layers

* Most on-device ML runtimes follow a layered architecture consisting of the following components:

  + **Model Loader / Parser**: Responsible for reading serialized model files (e.g., `.mlmodel`, `.tflite`, `.onnx`, `.pt`, etc.) and converting them into an internal representation suitable for execution.
  + **Serialization Format:** Defines how models are stored on disk. Most runtimes use specialized formats (e.g., FlatBuffer in TFLite, Protobuf in TensorFlow/ONNX). Protobuf offers fast binary encoding and structured metadata representation, and is common in ONNX (`.onnx`) and TensorFlow (`.pb`) models.
  + **Intermediate Representation (IR)**: Some runtimes convert models into an internal graph or IR that enables further optimization and abstraction from the original framework.
  + **Kernel / Operator Library**: A collection of pre-implemented mathematical operations (e.g., convolution, matmul, ReLU) that form the backbone of computation. These may be hand-optimized for specific CPU, GPU, NPU, or DSP targets.
  + **Execution Engine / Scheduler**: Coordinates the evaluation of the computational graph, manages dependencies, and dispatches workloads to the appropriate hardware accelerators.
  + **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**: Encapsulates hardware-specific APIs and provides runtime support for leveraging specialized units like Apple’s ANE, Qualcomm’s Hexagon DSP, or CUDA cores on NVIDIA GPUs.

    fatalError("Model failed to load")
}

let input = try? MLMultiArray(shape: [1, 3, 224, 224], dataType: .float32)
// Fill input array with pixel data

let output = try? model.prediction(input: input!)
print(output?.classLabel ?? "Prediction failed")
```

## MLX Deep Dive

* MLX (Machine Learning eXperimentation) is a relatively new Apple-developed machine learning framework built specifically for Apple Silicon. It is designed for flexibility, research, and experimentation, offering a PyTorch-like Python API with eager and compiled execution. Unlike Core ML, which targets app integration and production deployment, MLX is meant for model development, prototyping, and edge inference—while taking full advantage of Apple hardware like the M-series chips.
* Put simply, MLX is particularly well-suited for developers focused on rapid iteration and fine-tuning of models on Apple devices. It’s promising for LLMs and vision transformers on MacBooks and other Apple Silicon-powered hardware.

### Overview

* **Developer Target**: ML researchers and developers using Apple Silicon
* **Use Cases**: Research, fine-tuning models on-device, LLM inference, Apple-optimized ML pipelines
* **Model Format**: No proprietary serialized model format; models are expressed in Python source code using `mlx.nn` layers
* **Conversion Tools**: Emerging support for PyTorch model import via `mlx-trace` and ONNX conversion

### Architecture

* MLX is a minimal and composable tensor library that uses Apple’s Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) and optionally the Apple Neural Engine (ANE) for hardware acceleration.
* **Execution Modes**:

  + **Eager Execution**: Immediate computation for prototyping/debugging
  + **Compiled Graph**: Via `mlx.compile()` for performance-critical inference
* **Core Components**:

  + `mlx.core`: Tensor definitions and low-level math operations
  + `mlx.nn`: High-level neural network module abstraction (analogous to PyTorch’s `nn.Module`)
  + `mlx.optimizers`: Gradient-based optimizers for training
  + `mlx.transforms`: Preprocessing utilities (e.g., normalization, resizing)
* **Hardware Abstraction**:

  + Primarily targets the GPU via MPS
  + MLX compiler performs static analysis to optimize kernel dispatch and memory usage
  + ANE support is still evolving and model-dependent

### Implementation Details

* **Tensor Memory Model**:

  + MLX tensors are immutable
  + Operations generate new tensors rather than mutating in-place
  + Enables functional purity and easier graph compilation
* **JIT Compilation**:

  + While code is typically run in Python, MLX allows functions to be decorated with `@mlx.compile` to trace and compile computation graphs
  + Reduces memory allocations and kernel overhead
* **Custom Modules**:

  + Developers can create custom layers by subclassing `mlx.nn.Module`
  + Supports standard layers like `Linear`, `Conv2d`, `LayerNorm`, etc.
* **Interoperability**:

  + MLX includes tools to convert PyTorch models using tracing (WIP)
  + No built-in ONNX or TensorFlow Lite importer yet, though development is ongoing

### Pros and Cons

* **Pros:**

  + Highly optimized for Apple Silicon (especially M1/M2)
  + Lightweight and minimalist API with functional programming style
  + Supports training and inference on-device
  + Fast experimentation with eager mode and compilation toggle
  + Tensor API is intuitive for PyTorch users
* **Cons:**

  + Only runs on macOS with Apple Silicon (no iOS, no Windows/Linux)
  + Ecosystem still maturing (e.g., fewer pre-trained models, limited documentation)
  + No official deployment format—source code is the model
  + Interop with other frameworks is under active development but not production-ready

### Example Code Snippet

```
import mlx.core as mx
import mlx.nn as nn

class SimpleMLP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(784, 256)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(256, 10)

    def __call__(self, x):
        x = self.linear1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        return self.linear2(x)

model = SimpleMLP()
input = mx.random.normal((1, 784))
output = model(input)

print("Prediction:", output)
```

* For accelerated inference:

```
compiled_fn = mx.compile(model)
output = compiled_fn(input)
```

## ONNX Runtime Deep Dive

* ONNX Runtime (ORT) is a cross-platform, high-performance inference engine for deploying models in the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format. Maintained by Microsoft, it is widely adopted due to its flexibility, extensibility, and support for numerous hardware backends. ONNX itself is an open standard that enables interoperability between ML frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn.

### Overview

* **Developer Target**: Application developers, MLOps teams, platform architects
* **Use Cases**: Cross-framework inference, model portability, production deployments (cloud + edge), hardware acceleration
* **Model Format**: `.onnx` (Open Neural Network Exchange format)
* **Conversion Tools**: `torch.onnx.export`, `tf2onnx`, `skl2onnx`, and many others

### Architecture

* ONNX Runtime is structured around a pluggable and modular execution engine, making it suitable for CPU, GPU, and specialized accelerators. It uses an intermediate computation graph optimized at load time, and delegates computation to “Execution Providers” (EPs).
* **Execution Flow**:

  1. **Model Load**: Parses the `.onnx` model file into an internal graph representation.
  2. **Graph Optimization**: Applies a set of graph rewrite passes—like constant folding, node fusion, and dead node elimination.
  3. **Execution Provider Selection**: Based on available hardware and EP priorities, operators are assigned to execution backends.
  4. **Execution**: ORT schedules and dispatches kernel calls for each partition of the graph.
  5. **Output Handling**: Results are returned in native types or via C/C++/Python APIs.
* **Key Components**:

  + **Session**: `InferenceSession` is the main object for loading and running models.
  + **Execution Providers (EPs)**: Modular backend plugins such as:

    - CPU (default)
    - CUDA (NVIDIA GPUs)
    - DirectML (Windows GPU)
    - OpenVINO (Intel accelerators)
    - NNAPI (Android)
    - CoreML (iOS/macOS)
    - TensorRT
    - QNN (Qualcomm AI Engine)
  + **Graph Transformer**: Rewrites and optimizes the computation graph
  + **Kernel Registry**: Maps ONNX ops to optimized implementations

### Implementation Details

* **Model Format**:

  + ONNX models are stored in protobuf format
  + Static computation graph with explicit type and shape information
  + Supports operator versioning to ensure backward compatibility
* **Customization**:

  + Developers can register custom ops and execution providers
  + Optional use of external initializers and custom inference contexts
* **Execution Optimization**:

  + Graph transformation level can be controlled (basic, extended, all)
  + EPs can share execution (e.g., some layers on CPU, others on GPU)
  + Quantization and sparsity-aware execution supported via tools like `onnxruntime-tools`
* **Mobile Support**:

  + ONNX Runtime Mobile: A statically linked, size-reduced runtime
  + Works with Android and iOS, using NNAPI, Core ML, or CPU fallback

### Pros and Cons

* **Pros:**

  + Framework agnostic and highly interoperable
  + Broad hardware support via modular execution providers
  + Strong community and industrial backing (Microsoft, AWS, NVIDIA, etc.)
  + Mobile support with optimized builds and quantized execution
  + Extensive language bindings (Python, C++, C#, Java)
* **Cons:**

  + Debugging can be complex across EPs
  + Conversion process from other frameworks may require custom scripts
  + ONNX opset compatibility issues can arise across versions
  + Mobile optimization (size, latency) requires manual tuning

### Example Code Snippet (Python)

```
import onnxruntime as ort
import numpy as np

# Load ONNX model
session = ort.InferenceSession("resnet50.onnx")

# Prepare input
input_name = session.get_inputs()[0].name
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 3, 224, 224).astype(np.float32)

# Run inference
outputs = session.run(None, {input_name: input_data})

print("Prediction shape:", outputs[0].shape)
```

**Using CUDA Execution Provider**:

```
session = ort.InferenceSession("resnet50.onnx", providers=['CUDAExecutionProvider'])
```

### Use in Edge / On-Device Scenarios

* ONNX Runtime Mobile is specifically designed for deployment on edge devices. Key features include:

  + Stripped-down build (~1–2 MB)
  + FlatBuffer format support in preview
  + Android NNAPI and iOS Core ML integration
  + Prebuilt minimal runtime packages for specific models
* ONNX Runtime is best suited for applications where:

  + Portability across hardware is essential
  + Mixed execution (CPU + accelerator) is beneficial
  + The model pipeline involves multiple frameworks

## ExecuTorch Deep Dive

* ExecuTorch is a lightweight runtime and deployment framework built by Meta (Facebook) to run PyTorch models on constrained edge devices, including microcontrollers (MCUs), embedded systems, and mobile hardware. It is designed with the principles of minimalism, portability, and execution efficiency. Unlike full PyTorch runtimes, ExecuTorch leverages Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation and produces compact bytecode representations of models.

* **Conversion Tools**: PyTorch \(\rightarrow\) TorchScript \(\rightarrow\) ExecuTorch via AOT pipeline

### Architecture

* ExecuTorch redefines the execution pipeline for PyTorch models in low-resource environments. Its architecture includes a static graph compiler, a runtime interpreter, and pluggable dispatch interfaces for targeting different hardware backends.
* **Execution Flow**:

  1. **Model Export**:

     + Model defined in PyTorch and traced/scripted via TorchScript.
     + ExecuTorch’s AOT compiler converts it into a compact bytecode format.
  2. **Runtime Embedding**:

import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class TinyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(4, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

model = TinyModel()
scripted = torch.jit.script(model)
scripted.save("model.pt")
```

* **ExecuTorch AOT Compilation (CLI or CMake):**

```

* ExecuTorch fills a critical niche for deploying PyTorch-trained models on hardware where traditional runtimes like TensorFlow Lite or ONNX Runtime are too heavy.

## LidarTLM Deep Dive

* LidarTLM (LiDAR Tensor Layer Module) is a specialized, lower-profile runtime or processing pipeline designed for inference on LiDAR data using neural networks. It is not a mainstream or widely standardized runtime like TensorFlow Lite or ONNX Runtime, but rather refers to a class of embedded software tools tailored for 3D point cloud inference and fusion with temporal data—typically in autonomous systems, robotics, or advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).
* Because LidarTLM is less commonly documented and may refer to proprietary or research-centric toolkits, this section will focus on generalized design principles, use cases, and what distinguishes LiDAR-focused runtimes from general-purpose ML engines.

### Overview

* **Developer Target**: Robotics, ADAS, and autonomous system engineers
* **Use Cases**: Real-time 3D object detection, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), point cloud segmentation, obstacle avoidance
* **Model Format**: Often custom or adapted from PyTorch/ONNX; serialized as tensors or voxel grids
* **Conversion Tools**: Typically includes preprocessing pipelines from ROS, Open3D, or custom CUDA kernels

### Architecture

* LidarTLM-style systems typically deviate from conventional 2D image-based ML runtimes. They require efficient spatial processing, optimized memory layouts, and hardware support for sparse data structures.
* **Execution Flow**:

  1. **Sensor Input**: Raw LiDAR packets or fused multi-sensor data (e.g., IMU + LiDAR) ingested
  2. **Preprocessing**: Point clouds downsampled, voxelized, or transformed to Bird’s-Eye View (BEV)
  3. **Inference**: Tensorized data passed through neural layers (e.g., 3D convolutions, attention modules)
  4. **Postprocessing**: Bounding boxes or semantic maps generated
  5. **Fusion (Optional)**: Sensor fusion with radar, camera, or odometry
* **Key Components**:

  + **Spatial Encoder**: Transforms sparse point clouds into dense tensor formats (e.g., voxel grids, range images)
  + **Sparse CNNs or VoxelNet Layers**: Specialized convolution ops for irregular input data
  + **Temporal Modules**: Optional RNN, attention, or transformer blocks for sequential scans
  + **Hardware Abstraction**: Targets CUDA-enabled GPUs or embedded AI processors (e.g., NVIDIA Xavier, TI Jacinto)

### Implementation Details

* **Tensor Representation**:

  + Often uses sparse tensors or hybrid dense-sparse structures
  + Libraries like MinkowskiEngine, SpConv, or custom CUDA kernels for voxel ops
  + Quantization may be used to reduce memory footprint in embedded settings
* **Optimization Techniques**:

  + Efficient neighbor search (KD-trees, octrees) for local feature aggregation
  + Temporal caching of features from prior scans
  + Batch fusion for multi-sensor inputs
* **Deployment**:

  + Embedded platforms like NVIDIA Jetson, TI DSPs, and ADAS-grade microcontrollers
  + Often integrated with ROS (Robot Operating System) for I/O and control flow
  + May use C++, CUDA, or even custom ASIC/NPU firmware for deterministic performance

### Pros and Cons

* **Pros:**

  + Designed for spatial and temporal data, not just 2D tensors
  + Optimized for sparse inputs and low-latency inference
  + Supports sensor fusion pipelines, enabling richer context
  + Can run on edge-grade GPUs or embedded NPUs
* **Cons:**

  + Fragmented tooling, often bespoke or tightly coupled to hardware
  + Lack of standardized runtime interface (unlike ONNX or TFLite)
  + Difficult to deploy across platforms without custom engineering
  + Sparse community and documentation; often buried in academic or industrial codebases

### Example Pseudocode Flow

```
# Step 1: Load point cloud
point_cloud = load_lidar_scan("/scans/frame_001.bin")

# Step 2: Convert to voxel grid
voxel_grid = voxelize(point_cloud, grid_size=(0.1, 0.1, 0.1))

# Step 3: Pass through 3D CNN
features = sparse_conv_net(voxel_grid)

# Step 4: Predict bounding boxes or labels
detections = decode_bounding_boxes(features)

# Step 5: Fuse with other sensors (optional)
fused_output = fuse_with_camera(detections, rgb_frame)
```

### Suitable Applications

* Autonomous vehicles (3D perception stacks)
* Warehouse robots and drones
* Industrial inspection systems
* Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS)
* SLAM systems for robotics
* LidarTLM-like runtimes are not meant for general ML workloads but are highly optimized for 3D spatiotemporal inference, where conventional 2D model runtimes fall short. They tend to be integrated deep into hardware-specific SDKs or research frameworks.

### `llama.cpp` Deep Dive

* `llama.cpp` is an open-source, C++-based implementation of inference for large language models (LLMs), originally inspired by Meta’s LLaMA family. It focuses on efficient CPU (and optionally GPU) inference for quantized transformer models. Unlike full ML runtimes, `llama.cpp` is specialized, minimalist, and optimized for running LLMs—particularly on devices with constrained memory and compute budgets such as laptops, desktops, and even smartphones.

### Overview

* **Developer Target**: LLM researchers, app developers, hobbyists
* **Use Cases**: Local chatbots, privacy-preserving LLM apps, embedded NLP on edge devices
* **Model Format**: Quantized GGUF (GPT-generated GGML Unified Format)
* **Conversion Tools**: Python conversion scripts from PyTorch checkpoints to GGUF

### Architecture

* `llama.cpp` does not use a traditional ML runtime stack. It is built from the ground up with custom tensor operations and a static execution loop tailored to transformer inference.
* **Execution Flow**:

  1. **Model Load**: Quantized GGUF file loaded into memory
  2. **KV Cache Allocation**: Allocates buffers for key/value attention caching
  3. **Token Embedding & Input Prep**: Maps token IDs to embeddings
  4. **Layer Execution Loop**: Runs transformer blocks sequentially
  5. **Logits Output**: Computes next-token logits, passed to sampler
  6. **Sampling & Token Generation**: Greedy, top-k, nucleus, or temperature sampling
* **Key Components**:

  + **GGML Backend**: Custom tensor library with support for CPU SIMD ops (AVX, FMA, NEON)
  + **Quantization Layers**: 4-bit, 5-bit, and 8-bit quantized matmuls
  + **Inference Loop**: Manually unrolled transformer stack—one layer at a time
  + **KV Cache Management**: Token sequence history for autoregressive decoding
* **Optional GPU Support**:

  + Metal (macOS), OpenCL, CUDA support via modular backends
  + Offloading options: attention only, matmuls only, or full GPU

### Implementation Details

* **Model Quantization**:

  + Tools like `quantize.py` convert PyTorch models to GGUF format
  + Supports several quantization strategies (Q4\_0, Q5\_K, Q8\_0, etc.)
  + Tradeoff between model size and accuracy
* **Tensor Engine**:

  + No external libraries like BLAS, cuDNN, or MKL used by default
  + Uses hand-optimized C++ with platform-specific intrinsics
  + Cross-platform: macOS, Linux, Windows, WebAssembly (via WASM)
* **Memory Optimization**:

  + Memory mapped file support (`mmap`)
  + Low memory mode: restricts KV cache or context length
  + Paging and streaming support for large contexts (e.g., `llama.cpp + vLLM`)
* **Integration**:

  + C API and Python bindings (`llama-cpp-python`)
  + Works with tools like LangChain, OpenRouter, and Ollama
  + Compatible with most LLaMA-family models: LLaMA, Alpaca, Vicuna, Mistral, etc.

### Pros and Cons

* **Pros:**

  + Extremely fast CPU inference (real-time on MacBook M1/M2, even some Raspberry Pi 4)
  + Portable and minimal dependencies
  + Quantization enables running models with <4 GB RAM
  + Easily embedded into apps, games, and command-line tools
  + Active community and ecosystem (used in projects like Ollama and LM Studio)
* **Cons:**

  + Transformer-only; not a general ML runtime
  + No training support—strictly for inference
  + Manual conversion and tuning process required
  + Limited ops support; cannot easily add new ML layers

### Example CLI Inference

```
./main -m models/llama-7B.Q4_0.gguf -p "What is the capital of France?" -n 64
```

* **Python Inference (via `llama-cpp-python`)**:

```
from llama_cpp import Llama

llm = Llama(model_path="llama-7B.Q4_0.gguf")
output = llm("Q: What is the capital of France?\nA:", max_tokens=32)
print(output["choices"][0]["text"])
```

* **WebAssembly Example (Browser):**

  + Precompiled WASM version can run LLMs client-side using WebGPU
  + Useful for private, offline AI assistants directly in browser

### Suitable Applications

* Private, offline chatbots
* Voice assistants embedded in hardware
* Context-aware agents in games or productivity apps
* Developer tools with local NLP capabilities
* `llama.cpp` showcases what is possible with small, optimized transformer runtimes and CPU-centric design. It’s not a general-purpose ML runtime but a powerful engine for language inference where privacy, portability, or internet-free operation is desired.

## TensorFlow Lite / TensorFlow Serving Deep Dive

* TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) and TensorFlow Serving are two distinct components from the TensorFlow ecosystem optimized for inference, but they serve different purposes and deployment environments.
* **TensorFlow Lite** is designed for **on-device inference**, particularly for mobile, embedded, and IoT platforms.
* **TensorFlow Serving** is designed for **cloud and server-side model deployment**, providing high-throughput, low-latency model serving over gRPC or HTTP.
* This section focuses primarily on **TensorFlow Lite** due to its relevance to on-device ML runtimes, with a comparative note on Serving at the end.

### Overview

* **Developer Target**: Mobile developers, embedded engineers, production ML ops
* **Use Cases**: Real-time image classification, object detection, audio processing, NLP, edge analytics
* **Model Format**: `.tflite` (FlatBuffer format)
* **Conversion Tools**: TensorFlow \(\rightarrow\) TFLite via `TFLiteConverter`

### TensorFlow Lite Architecture

* TFLite’s design emphasizes performance, size efficiency, and hardware acceleration. It is structured around a model interpreter, a delegate mechanism for hardware acceleration, and a set of optimized operator kernels.
* **Execution Flow**:

  1. **Model Conversion**:

     + Uses `TFLiteConverter` to convert SavedModel or Keras models into a FlatBuffer-encoded `.tflite` model.
  2. **Model Load**:

     + The model is loaded by the `Interpreter` class on the target device.
  3. **Tensor Allocation**:

     + Memory buffers for input/output tensors are allocated.
  4. **Inference Execution**:

     + The interpreter evaluates the computation graph, optionally using delegates.
  5. **Postprocessing**:

     + Output tensors are read and interpreted by the application.
* **Key Components**:

  + **FlatBuffer Model**: Compact, zero-copy, serializable model format
  + **Interpreter**: Core engine that evaluates the model graph
  + **Delegate Interface**: Offloads subgraphs to specialized hardware (GPU, DSP, NPU)
  + **Kernel Registry**: Maps ops to optimized C++ implementations (or delegates)

### Implementation Details

* **Model Conversion**:

  + Converts SavedModels, Keras `.h5`, or concrete functions to `.tflite`
  + Supports post-training quantization (dynamic, full integer, float16)
  + Model optimizations include constant folding, op fusion, and pruning
* **Delegates**:

  + Optional hardware acceleration backends:

    - **NNAPI** (Android)
    - **GPU Delegate** (OpenCL, Metal)
    - **Hexagon Delegate** (Qualcomm DSP)
    - **Core ML Delegate** (iOS/macOS)
    - **EdgeTPU Delegate** (Coral devices)
  + Delegates work by “claiming” supported subgraphs during interpreter initialization
* **Threading and Performance**:

  + Supports multi-threaded inference
  + Interpreter can be run in C++, Java, Kotlin, Python, Swift

### TensorFlow Serving (Short Overview)

* Designed for scalable deployment of TensorFlow models on servers
* Models are exposed as REST/gRPC endpoints
* Automatically loads, unloads, and versions models
* Uses `SavedModel` format, not `.tflite`
* Not suitable for offline or embedded deployment
* **Use Case Comparison**:

Here is your formatted table following the provided style:

| **Feature** | **TensorFlow Lite** | **TensorFlow Serving** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Target Device | Mobile/Edge | Cloud/Server |
| Model Format | `.tflite` | SavedModel |
| Communication | In-process / Local | gRPC / REST |
| Latency | Milliseconds | Sub-second to seconds |
| Training Support | No | No (inference only) |
| Deployment Size | Small (~100s of KB) | Large, server framework |

### Pros and Cons

* **Pros (TensorFlow Lite):**

  + Compact and efficient format (FlatBuffer)
  + Broad hardware delegate support
  + Quantization-aware and post-training optimizations
  + Cross-platform support (iOS, Android, Linux, microcontrollers)
  + Strong ecosystem and pre-trained model zoo (`tflite-model-maker`)
* **Cons (TensorFlow Lite):**

  + Not a full subset of TensorFlow ops (requires op whitelisting or custom ops)
  + Delegate behavior can be opaque and platform-dependent
  + Conversion can fail silently if unsupported ops are encountered
  + Debugging delegate fallbacks can be non-trivial

### Example Inference (Python - TFLite)

```
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Load model
interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path="mobilenet_v2.tflite")
interpreter.allocate_tensors()

# Prepare input
input_details = interpreter.get_input_details()
output_details = interpreter.get_output_details()
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 224, 224, 3).astype(np.float32)

# Run inference
interpreter.set_tensor(input_details[0]['index'], input_data)
interpreter.invoke()
output_data = interpreter.get_tensor(output_details[0]['index'])
print("Prediction:", output_data)
```

* **Delegate usage (Android NNAPI, example via Java/Kotlin):**

```
Interpreter.Options options = new Interpreter.Options();
options.addDelegate(new NnApiDelegate());
Interpreter interpreter = new Interpreter(tfliteModel, options);
```

### Suitable Applications

* On-device health and fitness apps
* Real-time object detection in AR
* Offline voice recognition
* Edge anomaly detection
* TinyML deployments with `TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers`
* TensorFlow Lite remains one of the most production-hardened and flexible runtimes for on-device ML, particularly in mobile and embedded contexts. Its support for multiple delegates and optimizations makes it a go-to choice for developers deploying models outside the cloud.

### Comparative Analysis

* Here are detailed tabular comparisons that encapsulates all key aspects across the different on-device ML runtimes discussed in the primer.

### Runtime Selection Guidance

* **If you’re deploying to iOS or macOS**:

  + Use **Core ML** for production apps.
  + Use **MLX** for research, local experimentation, or custom modeling.
* **If you’re deploying to embedded edge devices**:

  + Use **ExecuTorch** for PyTorch-based workflows.
  + Use **TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers** for tight memory constraints.
  + Consider **LidarTLM**-style tools if dealing with 3D spatial data.
* **If you’re targeting Android or need portability**:

  + Use **TensorFlow Lite** or **ONNX Runtime** with delegates like NNAPI or GPU.
* **If you’re working with LLMs locally**:

  + Use **`llama.cpp`** for best CPU-based inference and minimal setup.
* **If you want cross-framework model portability**:

  + Use **ONNX Runtime** with models exported from PyTorch, TensorFlow, or others.
* **If you require real-time, high-volume cloud inference**:

  + Use **TensorFlow Serving** or ONNX Runtime Server.

### Final Thoughts

* Choosing the right on-device ML runtime depends heavily on the following factors:

  + Deployment environment (mobile, embedded, desktop, web, cloud)
  + Model architecture (CNN, RNN, transformer, etc.)
  + Performance requirements (latency, FPS, memory usage)
  + Development preferences (PyTorch, TensorFlow, raw C++, etc.)
  + Hardware capabilities (CPU, GPU, NPU, DSP, etc.)
* Each runtime discussed in this primer is best-in-class for a certain domain or design constraint. Rather than a “one-size-fits-all” solution, success in on-device ML depends on thoughtful matching between the model, target platform, and available tools. Here’s a summary of which is the best runtime across a range of scenarios:

  + **Best for Apple-native app development**: *Core ML*
  + **Best for Apple-based model experimentation**: *MLX*
  + **Best for cross-platform portability and hardware access**: *ONNX Runtime*
  + **Best for minimal embedded inference**: *ExecuTorch*
  + **Best for 3D LiDAR/robotics**: *LidarTLM-like stacks*
  + **Best for on-device LLM inference**: *`llama.cpp`*
  + **Best for mobile/embedded general ML**: *TensorFlow Lite*
  + **Best for scalable cloud inference**: *TensorFlow Serving*

## Related: Serialization Formats Across Runtimes

* In machine learning runtimes, how a model is **serialized**—i.e., stored and structured on disk—is critical for performance, compatibility, and portability. Serialization formats determine how the computation graph, parameters, metadata, and sometimes even execution plans are encoded and interpreted by the runtime. Each runtime typically adopts a format aligned with its optimization goals: whether that’s minimal size, fast loading, platform neutrality, or human-readability for debugging.
* Here we briefly compare four major serialization formats used across popular on-device ML runtimes: **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)**, **FlatBuffer**, **GGUF**, and **Bytecode formats**, reinforcing how data structures are stored, loaded, and interpreted at runtime.

### Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)

      table Tensor {
        shape: [int];
        type: int;
        buffer: int;
      }

      table Operator {
        opcode_index: int;
        inputs: [int];
        outputs: [int];
      }

      table Model {

## Model Execution Lifecycle Across ML Runtimes

* On-device and edge-focused ML runtimes vary widely in design, hardware support, and internal implementation. However, the overall lifecycle of executing a machine learning model—across any runtime—can be broken down into a common series of stages.
* This section provides a deep technical walkthrough of each stage in the lifecycle and sets the foundation for understanding how the specific runtimes (TensorRT, Core ML, MLX, ONNX Runtime, ExecuTorch, LidarTLM, llama.cpp, and TensorFlow Lite/Serving) customize or optimize these stages.
* Across all runtimes, model execution follows a common pipeline: convert the trained model into a runtime-compatible format, load and allocate memory, dispatch operations to hardware accelerators (CPU/GPU/NPU), and return structured outputs. Each runtime adapts this flow to its architecture—ranging from compiled CUDA engines (TensorRT) to VM-interpreted bytecode (ExecuTorch) to quantized transformer loops (llama.cpp)—to meet performance, portability, or resource constraints.

### General Workflow: From Model to Inference

#### Model Training

* Although training is typically performed in a full ML framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow), it is critical to know that the trained model must be **exported or converted** into a format compatible with the intended runtime.
* This stage outputs:

  + A trained model file (e.g., `.onnx`, `.mlmodel`, `.pt`, `.tflite`, etc.)
  + Associated metadata (input/output shapes, quantization info, etc.)

#### Model Conversion

* This phase adapts the trained model into a runtime-specific format. Conversion tools may also apply **graph simplification**, **quantization**, or **operator fusion**.
* Typical tools used:

  + `torch.onnx.export()` (PyTorch \(\rightarrow\) ONNX)
  + `coremltools.convert()` (\(\rightarrow\) Core ML)
  + `TFLiteConverter` (TensorFlow \(\rightarrow\) `.tflite`)
  + `executorchc` (TorchScript \(\rightarrow\) ExecuTorch bytecode)
  + `quantize.py` (for GGUF / `llama.cpp`)
* This phase outputs:

  + Serialized model file tailored for the target runtime
  + Optional quantized or optimized variant

#### Model Loading

* At runtime, the model file is loaded and deserialized into memory. Runtimes may parse the file into:

  + Internal intermediate representation (IR)
  + Execution graph
  + Bytecode or linear transformer stack (as in `llama.cpp`)
* Some runtimes use **zero-copy formats** (e.g., FlatBuffer in TFLite) to avoid overhead.

#### Memory Allocation

* Before inference can occur, the runtime must allocate:

  + Input and output tensor buffers
  + Working memory for intermediate computations
  + (If applicable) KV cache (for LLMs), kernel workspaces, or delegate buffers
* Advanced runtimes may precompute memory plans to avoid dynamic allocations (e.g., ExecuTorch, `llama.cpp`).

#### Inference Execution

* The core execution stage involves:

  + Running the model graph or stack
  + Dispatching operations (ops) to the appropriate hardware backend (CPU, GPU, NPU)
  + Managing control flow, caching, and batching
* Different runtimes handle scheduling and dispatch differently:

  + TensorRT: CUDA engine with explicit graph scheduling
  + TFLite: Static interpreter with delegate hand-off
  + ONNX Runtime: Execution Providers (EPs)
  + `llama.cpp`: Single-threaded or parallel transformer loop

#### Postprocessing & Output

* The final outputs are:

  + Raw logits, class probabilities, bounding boxes, text, etc.
  + Returned via API calls (C++, Python, Swift, etc.)
* This stage may also include:

  + Dequantization
  + Formatting into app-native types (e.g., Swift structs in Core ML)
  + Logging and telemetry

#### Lifecycle Optimization (Optional but Critical)

* For deployment, optimization techniques may be inserted at multiple points:

  + Quantization (during conversion)
  + Delegate configuration (runtime initialization)
  + Memory pruning and op fusion (during compile/AOT phase)
  + Execution profiling and tuning

### Runtime-Specific Execution Lifecycles

* While the general lifecycle described earlier applies to all runtimes, each ML runtime adapts or specializes this flow to match its architectural goals and supported hardware.
* This section provides an **execution lifecycle breakdown** for each runtime discussed in the original primer, with particular focus on runtime-specific logic during model loading, graph execution, memory management, and hardware dispatch.

#### TensorRT Execution Lifecycle (NVIDIA GPUs)

  + Supports sub-MB runtime environments
  + Highly tunable; model format ≠ PyTorch IR

#### LidarTLM Execution Lifecycle (LiDAR-Focused Embedded Stacks)

* LidarTLM-style runtimes are not general-purpose, but highly optimized for 3D spatial inference using sparse tensor pipelines.
* **Lifecycle Stages:**

  + **Sensor Input:** LiDAR frames streamed in real-time
  + **Preprocessing:** Voxelization or range transformation into tensor-friendly formats
  + **Tensor Pipeline:** Sparse CNNs, 3D convolutions, and attention modules process data

## Related: CPU Operator Libraries/Backends

* [`FBGEMM`](https://github.com/pytorch/FBGEMM), [`QNNPACK`](https://github.com/pytorch/QNNPACK), and [`XNNPACK`](https://github.com/google/XNNPACK) are high-performance CPU operator libraries used by runtimes (and frameworks embedding a runtime) to execute model operators efficiently.
* Note that quantization is performed by the framework either during inference (dynamic), training-time (QAT), or post-training (PTQ), producing per-tensor or per-channel scales/zero-points \((s, z)\) or \((s\_c, z\_c)\) via the affine map \(x\_q=\mathrm{clip}\_{[q\_{\min},\,q\_{\max}]}(\mathrm{round}(x/s)+z)\) with dequantization \(x\approx s\,(x\_q-z)\). These backends (`FBGEMM`, `QNNPACK`, and `XNNPACK`) do not perform quantization but rather consume these parameters and the resulting low-precision tensors (or unquantized floating-point tensors for XNNPACK paths) to run inference kernels efficiently.
* [`FBGEMM`](https://github.com/pytorch/FBGEMM) targets x86/servers with fast `int8` GEMM/conv; [`QNNPACK`](https://github.com/pytorch/QNNPACK) targets ARM/mobile CPUs with optimized `int8` conv/GEMM/activations; [`XNNPACK`](https://github.com/google/XNNPACK) focuses on fast `float32` kernels with some `int8` paths and commonly handles float ops.

### Overview

* This quick overview shows how [`FBGEMM`](https://github.com/pytorch/FBGEMM), [`QNNPACK`](https://github.com/pytorch/QNNPACK), and [`XNNPACK`](https://github.com/google/XNNPACK) fit into the CPU inference stack—what they do, what they don’t, and when runtimes route ops to them:

  + **Primary purpose**: Efficient execution of CPU kernels (conv/GEMM, depthwise conv, elementwise ops) for float and/or 8-bit quantized tensors.
  + **They do not**: Choose quantization parameters, calibrate ranges, or convert weights—framework/tooling does that.
  + **Where they fit**: After model conversion and quantization, the runtime dispatches supported ops to one of these libraries based on platform and data type.

### [`FBGEMM`](https://github.com/pytorch/FBGEMM) (by Meta,; Server CPUs)

* **Target platforms**: x86-64 server/desktop CPUs with SIMD (AVX2, AVX-512; newer stacks can leverage AMX on recent Intel parts via higher-level integrations).
* **Data types and quant schemes**: `int8`/`uint8` activations (affine per-tensor), `int8` weights (often symmetric per-channel). 32-bit accumulation with requantization to `int8`/`uint8` or dequantization to float. Also provides row-wise and 4-bit embedding quantization utilities for recommendation models.
* **Operator coverage**: Linear/GEMM and convolution (including groupwise), prepacked weight paths; optimized im2col/IGEMM; embedding bag and sparse length ops for recsys.
* **Optimizations**: Weight pre-packing into cache-friendly blocked layouts; vectorized micro-kernels; cache- and register-blocking; fused bias+activation+requant paths; threadpool parallelism.
* **Typical use**: PyTorch quantized ops on server/desktop CPUs (e.g., dynamic quantized Linear/LSTM, static `int8` conv/linear). Best when you need maximum x86 performance for `int8` inference.
  ; Mobile CPUs)
* **Target platforms**: ARM/ARM64 mobile CPUs with NEON (Android/iOS); designed for low-power cores.
* **Data types and quant schemes**: `uint8`/`int8` activations (affine per-tensor), `int8` per-channel weights; 32-bit accumulation with efficient requantization.
* **Operator coverage**: Quantized convolution/IGEMM, depthwise conv, deconvolution, fully connected (GEMM), pooling, various activation/elementwise ops.
* **Optimizations**: NHWC-friendly kernels; careful cache use for small batch/small filters; per-thread micro-kernels; fused post-ops to reduce memory traffic.
* **Typical use**: PyTorch Mobile’s quantized back end on ARM; good default for mobile `int8` CNNs and fully connected layers where you need predictable latency on phones.

### [`XNNPACK`](https://github.com/google/XNNPACK) (by Google,; both Server and Mobile CPUs)

* **Target platforms**: ARM/ARM64, x86-64, and WebAssembly (WASM); broadly portable and actively maintained.
* **Data types and quant schemes**: Strong `float32`/`float16`/`bfloat16` coverage; mature QS8/QU8 (signed/unsigned 8-bit) inference for conv/GEMM/elementwise with per-channel weight scales. 32-bit accumulation and precise requantization.
* **Operator coverage**: Convolution (standard and depthwise), fully connected, pooling, deconvolution, elementwise math, softmax, activation functions, resize, etc.
* **Optimizations**: Handwritten micro-kernels per ISA (NEON/AVX/AVX512), NHWC dataflow, weight prepacking, GEMM/IGEMM families with cache-aware blocking, parallel work-stealing.
* **Typical use**: TensorFlow Lite’s XNNPACK delegate on CPU (float and `int8`), and increasingly as a CPU backend in other frameworks for both float and quantized inference.

### What to Choose When?

* **PyTorch (desktop/server CPU)**: `FBGEMM` is the usual backend for quantized ops; dynamic quantized Linear/LSTM also route here.
* **PyTorch Mobile (ARM)**: `QNNPACK` is the historical default for quantized ops; some float operators can use XNNPACK.
* **TensorFlow Lite (CPU)**: `XNNPACK` delegate accelerates many `float32` and `int8` ops; the interpreter falls back to reference kernels when needed.
* **ONNX Runtime (CPU)**: Uses its own CPU kernels by default, but can be built/integrated with these libraries in certain configurations; on mobile, builds commonly leverage `XNNPACK`.

### Design Notes

* **Quant params are part of tensors**: Kernels need correct scales/zero-points. For per-channel weights, pass channel-wise scales; activations are usually per-tensor.
* **Accumulation width**: 8-bit multiply-accumulates are summed into 32-bit accumulators to avoid overflow, then requantized. Watch for saturation when chaining ops.
* **Prepack once**: Pre-pack and reuse weights to avoid paying packing costs per inference. Many APIs expose prepacked weight objects.
* **Layout matters**: These libraries typically prefer NHWC for conv on mobile; mismatched layouts cause costly transposes.
* **Dynamic vs static quant**: Dynamic quantizes activations on-the-fly (common for Linear/LSTM), static uses calibration ranges. FBGEMM has strong dynamic Linear/LSTM paths.
* **Activation ranges**: Calibrate representative inputs to pick good scales and avoid clamp-heavy requantization.
