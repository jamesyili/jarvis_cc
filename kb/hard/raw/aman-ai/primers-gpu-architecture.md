## Overview

* Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are massively parallel processors originally designed for rendering graphics but now widely used for general-purpose high-throughput computing. Their architecture is optimized for workloads that can be parallelized, such as:

  + Graphics rendering (rasterization, shading, ray tracing)
  + Scientific computing
  + Machine learning training and inference
  + Simulation and data analytics
* Unlike CPUs, which prioritize low-latency execution of serial tasks, GPUs focus on high-throughput execution of many threads simultaneously.

## Fundamental Architectural Components

### Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)

* The SM is the fundamental execution unit in an NVIDIA GPU. Each SM contains:

  + Multiple CUDA cores (integer and floating-point ALUs)
  + Special Function Units (SFUs) for transcendental math
  + Tensor Cores for matrix-heavy operations (deep learning, HPC)
  + Load/store units for memory access
  + Warp schedulers for issuing instructions to warps

### CUDA Cores

* Handle general-purpose floating-point and integer operations.
* Organized into warps of 32 threads.
* Designed for SIMD-like execution, where all threads in a warp execute the same instruction.

### Tensor Cores

* Specialized hardware for matrix multiply-and-accumulate (MMA) operations.
* Key for AI/ML workloads (e.g., FP16, BF16, INT8 precision).
* Introduced in Volta, improved in each subsequent architecture.

### Ray Tracing (RT) Cores

* Accelerate BVH traversal and ray-triangle intersection tests for real-time ray tracing.
* First introduced in Turing architecture.

### Memory Hierarchy

* NVIDIA GPUs employ a multi-tier memory system:

  + **Registers** (per thread, lowest latency)
  + **Shared Memory / L1 Cache** (per SM, low latency, user-controlled or cache mode)
  + **L2 Cache** (shared across all SMs, higher capacity)
  + **Global Memory (VRAM)** (off-chip, high latency, GDDR6 or HBM)
  + **Texture and constant caches** (specialized caching units)

### Interconnects

* **NVLink**: High-bandwidth, low-latency GPU-to-GPU and GPU-to-CPU interconnect.
* **PCIe**: Standard system interconnect, slower than NVLink.

### Key Architectural Design Goals

1. **High Parallelism** – Scaling SM count and CUDA cores.
2. **Specialization** – Adding RT and Tensor Cores for dedicated workloads.
3. **Memory Bandwidth** – Using faster VRAM and wider buses.
4. **Energy Efficiency** – Improved performance per watt through better fabrication processes and architectural optimizations.
5. **Scalability** – Supporting multi-GPU setups with coherent memory models.

## Execution Paradigms in NVIDIA GPUs

* Execution in NVIDIA GPUs follows a **hierarchical, SIMT-based** (Single Instruction, Multiple Threads) model. Understanding this hierarchy is crucial before comparing how specific architectures (Ampere \(\rightarrow\) Blackwell) evolved.

### Thread and Warp Model

* **Thread**:
  + The smallest unit of execution. Each thread has its own registers, program counter, and can execute independently, but in practice, threads are grouped for efficiency.
* **Warp**:
  + A warp is a group of **32 threads** that execute the same instruction in lockstep on a single SM.
    - If threads within a warp diverge (take different branches), execution is serialized for each path until they reconverge (warp divergence penalty).
    - Warps are the main scheduling unit in NVIDIA GPUs.

### Thread Blocks and Grids

* **Thread Block (also known as Cooperative Thread Array)**:
  + A thread block, also called a Cooperative Thread Array (CTA), is a group of threads (typically up to 1024) organized in 1D, 2D, or 3D layouts that work together, sharing data via shared memory and synchronizing their execution.
    - Threads in a block share **SM-local resources** such as shared memory and L1 cache.
    - A block is always executed on a single SM (cannot span multiple SMs).
* **Grid**:
  + A grid is a set of thread blocks launched for a kernel execution.
    - Can have 1D, 2D, or 3D configuration.
    - Enables scaling up to millions of threads.

### SIMT Execution Model

* SIMT is similar to SIMD but with more flexibility—each thread has its own instruction state, yet warps execute in a vector-like fashion.
* Hardware warp schedulers select ready warps each cycle to hide memory latency.
* The SIMT model allows massive parallelism while tolerating high memory access latencies.

### Warp Scheduling

* Each SM contains **warp schedulers** (number varies by architecture).
* The scheduler chooses one or more ready warps per cycle, issuing instructions to execution units.
* Techniques to maximize utilization:

  + **Latency hiding**: Switching to another ready warp when one stalls.
  + **Dual-issue**: Issuing two independent instructions in the same cycle.
  + **Specialized pipelines**: Routing instructions to CUDA cores, Tensor Cores, or SFUs.

### Synchronization and Communication

* **Intra-warp**: Implicit, as all threads execute in lockstep.
* **Intra-block**: Achieved via `__syncthreads()` barrier and shared memory.
* **Inter-block**: No built-in sync; requires multiple kernel launches or cooperative groups.

## Workflow: Running AI Models on NVIDIA GPUs

* Deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow offer high-level APIs to define, train, and deploy models. When these models are executed on NVIDIA GPUs, a well-defined sequence of steps is followed to convert Python-based model definitions into GPU-executable workloads. Below is a detailed breakdown of this workflow, focusing on how model computations map to GPU architecture.
* Running AI models on NVIDIA GPUs involves several coordinated layers: the high-level model definition, dispatch of operators to highly optimized CUDA kernels, memory transfers and execution on SMs, and runtime profiling. Modern GPUs—with their hierarchical memory, massive parallelism, and hardware-accelerated units like Tensor Cores—are architected to accelerate this end-to-end workflow. The software stack abstracts much of the complexity, enabling researchers and engineers to deploy models with minimal hardware-level code but with deep performance leverage.

### Model Definition and Training (CPU/GPU)

* Models are typically defined in Python using high-level APIs in PyTorch (`nn.Module`) or TensorFlow (`tf.keras.Model`). During training, operations like matrix multiplications, convolutions, and non-linearities are recorded dynamically (in PyTorch’s eager mode) or statically (in TensorFlow’s graph mode).
* If a GPU is available and selected (`device="cuda"` or `tf.device('/GPU:0')`), the framework schedules these computations for GPU execution.

### Operator Dispatch and Kernel Mapping

* Each tensor operation (e.g., `matmul`, `ReLU`, `conv2d`) corresponds to one or more GPU kernels. The deep learning framework uses backend libraries like:

  + **cuDNN** (for deep neural networks: convolutions, activation, normalization)
  + **cuBLAS** (for matrix algebra)
  + **cuFFT**, **cuSPARSE**, etc. (for specialized ops)
* These libraries provide pre-optimized CUDA kernels tailored for various tensor shapes and precisions (e.g., FP32, FP16, BF16, INT8). When a model executes, the framework dispatches operator calls to these GPU-optimized kernels via these libraries.

### Memory Management and Transfer

* Before execution, model parameters and inputs are moved to GPU memory (VRAM). PyTorch and TensorFlow both manage memory allocation, deallocation, and device transfers:

  + CPU to GPU: `tensor.to("cuda")` (PyTorch) or `.gpu()` context (TensorFlow)
  + GPU memory is allocated dynamically and reused to reduce fragmentation
  + Intermediate results during forward/backward passes are cached in GPU RAM to avoid excessive recomputation
* Efficient memory use is critical, especially for large models and high-resolution inputs.

### Kernel Launch and Execution on SMs

* Once data and operations are prepared, each operator triggers a **CUDA kernel launch**. This is where NVIDIA’s execution model comes into play:

  + Kernels are executed by **Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)**, leveraging thousands of **CUDA cores**
  + Work is parallelized into **warps** (32 threads), grouped into **thread blocks**
  + Tensor Cores accelerate operations like GEMMs and convolutions in mixed precision (FP16, BF16, TF32)
* The GPU’s warp schedulers manage kernel instruction dispatch, hide memory latency, and maximize throughput by overlapping compute and memory-bound operations.

### Forward and Backward Passes (Training)

* **Forward pass**: Model computations are executed layer by layer, and activations are stored.
* **Backward pass**: Gradients are computed using automatic differentiation, with additional kernels launched for each operation’s derivative.
* **Gradient updates**: Optimizer steps (e.g., Adam, SGD) are also dispatched to GPU kernels when tensors reside in GPU memory.
* All of this happens in the context of a training loop, with heavy reliance on GPU compute resources and memory bandwidth.

### Inference Deployment

* Once trained, the model is often exported for inference:

  + **TensorFlow:** SavedModel, TF Lite, or ONNX format
  + **PyTorch:** TorchScript, ONNX, or native PyTorch weights
* During inference, only the forward pass is executed. Frameworks and inference engines (like TensorRT, TorchServe, or TF Serving) strip unnecessary training components, optimize kernel ordering, and preload weights into GPU memory to reduce latency and maximize throughput.

### Precision Optimization

* To reduce GPU memory usage and increase performance, models often use:

  + **Mixed precision training** (e.g., `float16` for activations, `float32` for loss and gradients)
  + **Quantized inference** (e.g., `int8` for weights and activations)
    These techniques rely on the GPU’s Tensor Cores and require calibration or loss-scaling strategies for training stability.

### Runtime Tools and Profiling

* Execution can be monitored and optimized using:

  + **Nsight Compute/Systems**: Low-level GPU profiling
  + **TensorBoard**: Graph inspection and timing (TensorFlow)
  + **PyTorch Profiler**: Operator-level breakdown and bottleneck tracing
  + **NVIDIA’s CUPTI**: Provides hooks for collecting runtime metrics

## AMD GPU Architecture Overview and Comparison with NVIDIA

* AMD approaches GPU architecture with its own design philosophy, even while addressing many of the same core challenges as NVIDIA: massive parallelism, heterogeneous compute, high memory bandwidth, and scalable interconnects.
* Below, we’ll walk through **AMD’s architectural model** for the same thematic areas we covered for NVIDIA — and highlight where the two vendors align or differ.

### Fundamental Architectural Components (AMD)

* **Compute Units (CUs)**:

  + AMD’s equivalent of NVIDIA’s Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs).
  + Each CU contains:

    - **64 Stream Processors** (SPs, roughly equivalent to CUDA cores)
    - **Vector ALUs** for FP32/INT32
    - **Scalar Units** for FP32/INT32 operations shared across the CU
    - **Matrix Cores (AI Matrix Accelerators)** in newer RDNA/CDNA architectures for mixed-precision AI workloads.
  + CUs are grouped into Shader Arrays and Shader Engines.
* **Specialized Hardware**:

  + **Ray Accelerators** (since RDNA 2) — analogous to NVIDIA’s RT Cores.
  + **Matrix Cores** (CDNA and RDNA 3) — compete with NVIDIA’s Tensor Cores for AI/HPC workloads.
* **Memory Hierarchy**:

  + Registers per wavefront (equivalent to warp)
  + Local Data Share (LDS) — similar to NVIDIA’s shared memory, software-managed.
  + L1 Cache and scalar caches.
  + L2 Cache shared across CUs.
  + VRAM (GDDR6, GDDR6X, or HBM depending on SKU).

### Execution Paradigms (AMD)

* **Wavefronts**:

  + AMD’s equivalent to NVIDIA’s warps — **fixed at 64 threads** (vs. NVIDIA’s 32).
  + Like warps, wavefronts execute in lockstep using SIMD lanes.
* **Workgroups**:

  + Equivalent to NVIDIA’s CTAs (Cooperative Thread Arrays).
  + Workgroups contain one or more wavefronts and share LDS memory.
* **SIMD Execution**:

  + Each CU contains multiple SIMD units (typically 4×16-wide for wavefront64).
  + Supports predication and divergence handling similar to NVIDIA’s warp divergence model.
* **Scheduling**:

  + Hardware schedulers issue wavefront instructions to SIMD units.
  + AMD uses **asynchronous compute** extensively — multiple compute queues can be scheduled across the GPU concurrently.

### Compute Architecture Evolution (AMD CDNA & RDNA)

* **CDNA (Data Center, HPC)**:

  + Focused on FP64, large HBM bandwidth, Infinity Fabric interconnect.
  + MI100, MI200, MI300 accelerators target AI training/inference and HPC workloads.
  + Incorporates AI Matrix Cores for FP16/BF16/FP8 acceleration.
* **RDNA (Gaming & Consumer)**:

  + RDNA 2 (2020) — introduced hardware Ray Accelerators.
  + RDNA 3 (2022) — chiplet-based design, higher clock speeds, improved efficiency, larger L0/L1 caches.
* **Trends**:

  + Gradual convergence with NVIDIA’s philosophy on specialized cores for AI and ray tracing.
  + CDNA increasingly mirrors NVIDIA’s HPC-first approach, while RDNA focuses on gaming + mixed AI features.

### Floating-Point Precision Performance Evolution

* AMD’s HPC GPUs (CDNA) support a similar spread of precisions:

  + **FP64:** Full-rate or half-rate in CDNA for HPC.
  + **FP32:** High throughput in all architectures; RDNA targets gaming efficiency.
  + **FP16/BF16:** Supported in Matrix Cores for AI workloads.
  + **FP8:** Introduced in MI300 for AI inference acceleration.
  + **No FP4 yet** in shipping AMD hardware (as of 2025).
* **NVIDIA Comparison:**

  + AMD lagged behind in adopting sub-16-bit formats but has now matched FP8 capabilities in data center parts.
  + NVIDIA maintains an edge in software-optimized mixed-precision scheduling (Transformer Engine, FP4).

### Memory Architecture Evolution

* **VRAM Types**

  + **RDNA:** Primarily GDDR6 (with Infinity Cache to offset bandwidth needs).
  + **CDNA:** HBM2/HBM2e (MI100), HBM3 (MI250), HBM3e (MI300).
* **Cache Strategies**

  + **Infinity Cache** (RDNA 2 & 3) — very large L3 cache (up to 128 MB) to minimize VRAM accesses in gaming workloads.
  + L1/L2 sizes generally smaller than NVIDIA’s in absolute terms, but Infinity Cache changes bandwidth behavior.
* **Interconnects**

  + **Infinity Fabric** — scalable, high-bandwidth interconnect across dies or GPUs.
  + Competes with NVIDIA NVLink; excels in multi-GPU HPC configurations.
* **NVIDIA Comparison:**

  + NVIDIA tends to rely on increasing L2 cache size and raw VRAM bandwidth;
  + AMD focuses on large on-die caches (Infinity Cache) to improve effective bandwidth, especially in gaming SKUs.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Warp/Wavefront Size Difference:** NVIDIA’s 32-thread warps offer finer granularity, while AMD’s 64-thread wavefronts can be more efficient in highly parallel workloads but risk more idle lanes under divergence.
2. **Memory Philosophy:** NVIDIA favors enlarging L2 cache and maximizing bandwidth; AMD offsets narrower VRAM interfaces with large on-die Infinity Cache.
3. **AI Focus:** NVIDIA’s Transformer Engine and `float4` give it a precision flexibility edge for LLM workloads, while AMD is catching up rapidly in FP8 inference.
4. **Interconnect Strategy:** Both offer high-bandwidth interconnects (Infinity Fabric vs. NVLink), but NVIDIA currently scales to larger GPU counts in a single coherent memory space.
5. **Software Ecosystem:** NVIDIA’s CUDA ecosystem remains more mature, but AMD’s ROCm stack has made major strides in HPC adoption.
