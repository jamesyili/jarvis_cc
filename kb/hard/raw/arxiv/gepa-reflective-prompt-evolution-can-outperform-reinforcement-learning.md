ABSTRACT
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via rein-
forcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which
often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue that the interpretable na-
ture of language often provides a much richer learning medium for LLMs, compared to
policy gradients derived from sparse, scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA
(Genetic-Pareto), a prompt optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language re-
flection to learn high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one
or more LLM prompts, GEPA samples trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool calls, and tool
outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose problems, propose and test
prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons from the Pareto frontier of its own
attempts. As a result of GEPA’s design, it can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large
quality gain. Across six tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 6% on average and by up to
20%, while using up to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt op-
timizer, MIPROv2, by over 10% (e.g., +12% accuracy on AIME-2025), and demonstrates
promising results as an inference-time search strategy for code optimization. We release
our code at https://github.com/gepa-ai/gepa.

INTRODUCTION
Large language models (LLMs) have enabled development of agents and systems that combine fuzzy
natural-language specifications with tools like retrieval and code execution. This raises the question of how
LLMs should be optimized for downstream performance. One popular approach is Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), e.g. with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024),
which treats success metrics as end-of-rollout scalar rewards used to estimate policy gradients (Lambert,
2025). While these RL approaches are effective, they typically require tens of thousands of rollouts in prac-
tice to fit new tasks. For example, recent works leveraging GRPO typically use up to hundreds of thousands
of rollouts for training (Chen et al., 2025b; Wu et al., 2025b; Zhang et al., 2025; Jin et al., 2025; Si et al.,
2025; Wang et al., 2025a; Chen et al., 2025a; Sha et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2025a; Peng et al., 2025; Song
et al., 2025). This sample inefficiency can quickly become a serious bottleneck: many downstream LLM
applications invoke expensive tool calls, have limited inference budget for sampling from the LLM itself, or
simply cannot finetune the weights of the largest or best-performing LLMs.
We observe that rollouts sampled from even highly sophisticated LLM systems can be serialized into traces
of natural language: they contain nothing but the instructions of each LLM module, the resulting LLM
reasoning chains, tool calls, and potentially the internal workings of the reward function (e.g., compiler
error messages, before they are collapsed into scalar rewards). Because such serialized trajectories are
readily understood by modern LLMs, we argue that algorithms that learn deliberately in natural language
by reflecting on these trajectories can make more effective use of the strong language priors that LLMs have,
compared with standard RL approaches.
We introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a reflective prompt optimizer for compound AI systems that merges
textual reflection with multi-objective evolutionary search. GEPA iteratively mutates prompts using natural
language feedback drawn from new rollouts. In each mutation, the candidate prompt is derived from an
ancestor, accumulating high-level lessons derived from observations and LLM feedback. To avoid local
optima that afflict greedy prompt optimization, GEPA maintains a Pareto front: instead of evolving only the
global best prompt, it stochastically explores the top-performing prompts for each problem instance. This
diversification enables robust generalization and mitigates getting stuck in local minima.
We evaluate GEPA across multi-hop reasoning (HotpotQA; Yang et al. 2018), Math (AIME, LiveBench-
Math; Balunovi´c et al. (2025); White et al. (2025)), instruction following (IFBench; Pyatkin et al. 2025b),
privacy-aware delegation (PUPA; Li et al. 2025a), and retrieval-augmented verification (HoVer; Jiang et al.
2020), using both open (Qwen3 8B; Yang et al. 2025; Team 2025) and proprietary (GPT-4.1 Mini; OpenAI
2025) models. We find that GEPA generalizes well and is highly sample-efficient: on Qwen3 8B, it outper-
forms GRPO (24k rollouts) by up to 20% while using up to 35× fewer rollouts, with an average gain of +6%
across six tasks. GEPA also surpasses the prior state-of-the-art, MIPROv2 (Opsahl-Ong et al., 2024), on all
benchmarks and models, achieving +13% aggregate gains, over double MIPROv2’s +5.6%.
Qualitatively, GEPA-learned prompts are quite rich. Figure 2 shows excerpts from a prompt crafted for the
query-creation module of a multi-hop question answering system used in HotpotQA, and Figure 5 shows
that even a single reflective update often yields large gains. These results highlight that reflective prompt
evolution with language feedback enables improved sample efficiency and robust generalization, offering a
practical approach to optimizing complex AI workflows in data- or budget-constrained environments. We
also demonstrate GEPA as an inference-time search strategy for code optimization on NPUEval (Kalade &
Schelle, 2025) & KernelBench (Ouyang et al., 2025) in Sec 5.1, and for adversarial prompt search in Sec 5.2.

Seed Prompt for Second-Hop of Multi-Hop QA System
Given the fields question, summary_1, produce the fields query.
GEPA’s Optimized Prompt for Second-Hop of Multi-Hop QA System, GPT-4.1 Mini
You will be given two input fields: question and summary_1. Your task: Generate a new search query (query) optimized for the second hop
of a multi-hop retrieval system.
• The original user question is typically complex and requires information from multiple documents to answer.
• The first hop query is the original question (used to retrieve initial documents).
• Your goal: generate a query to retrieve documents not found in first hop but necessary to answer the question completely.
Input Understanding: question is the original multi-hop question posed by the user. summary_1 is a concise summary of information from a
document retrieved in the first hop, which partially addresses the question.
Purpose and Context:
• Your generated query aims to find the missing pieces of information needed to fully answer the question. . . .
• The query must retrieve relevant documents NOT found in first hop . . . for final answer extraction.
Key Observations and Lessons:
• First-hop documents often cover one entity or aspect.
• Remaining relevant documents often involve connected or higher-level concepts mentioned in summary_1 but not explicitly asked in the
original question. The query should target these missing, but logically linked, documents.
• Avoid merely paraphrasing the original question or restating known facts from summary_1.
• Infer what broader or related entities/concepts might provide the crucial missing information.
• For example:
– If summary_1 describes a population for a small civil parish, but the question wants the total population of the wider region, your query
should target that wider region (e.g., “Madeira archipelago population in 2011”).
– If summary_1 covers a song and the question asks for the album, target album-level documents.
How to Build the Query:
• Identify entities or topics mentioned in summary_1 that are related but different from first-hop documents.
• Reframe the query to explicitly mention these broader or related entities connected to the original question.
• Include relevant key context from the question to maintain specificity, but shift focus to the missing piece.
• The goal is to retrieve documents that link or complement what was retrieved initially.
Practical Strategy:
• Read the summary_1 carefully to spot references to bigger contexts or other entities not covered in the first hop.
• Ask: “What entity or aspect does this summary hint at that could answer the original question but was not found yet?”
• Formulate a precise, focused factual query targeting that entity or concept to retrieve the missing documents.
Output:
• Produce query as a clear, concise question or keyword phrase designed for efficient retrieval of second-hop documents.
• Ensure the query relates logically to the original question while targeting the broader or complementary knowledge identified in summary_1.
. . . Do not include the original question or simply rephrase it. Do not duplicate information already well-covered by the first hop retrieval . . .
Figure 2: This figure shows an example prompt generated by GEPA for the second-hop document retrieval to
be performed in a multi-hop question-answer system, along with the seed prompt it started with. Appendix L

chon (Saad-Falcon et al., 2025), etc. Following Soylu et al. (2024); Khattab et al. (2024); Opsahl-Ong et al.
(2024); Tan et al. (2025), we formalize such a system as Φ = (M, C, X, Y), where M = ⟨M1, . . . , M|M|⟩
denotes language modules, C specifies control flow logic, and X, Y are global input/output schemas. Each
module Mi = (πi, θi, Xi, Yi) is an LLM subcomponent: πi is its (system) prompt including instructions and
few-shot demonstrations; θi the underlying model weights; Xi, Yi are input/output schemas. At runtime, C
orchestrates the sequencing and invocation of modules—e.g., passing outputs from one module to another,
invoking modules conditionally, or leveraging tool APIs. This way, C can invoke different modules in any
order multiples of times.
Given Φ, let ΠΦ = ⟨π1, . . . , π|M|⟩denote the collection of all module prompts and ΘΦ = ⟨θ1, . . . , θ|M|⟩
the set of module weights. The learnable parameters are thus ⟨Π, Θ⟩Φ. For a task instance (x, m)—where x
maps to the input schema X and m contains evaluator metadata (e.g., gold answers, evaluation rubrics, code
unit tests)—the system induces an output y = Φ(x; ⟨Π, Θ⟩Φ). A metric µ : Y × M →[0, 1] then measures
the output quality of y with respect to metadata m (for example by calculating, exact match, F1, pass rate,
etc.). The optimization problem is thus defined as follows, where T is a task distribution.:
⟨Π∗, Θ∗⟩Φ = arg max
⟨Π,Θ⟩Φ E(x,m)∼T

µ
 Φ(x; ⟨Π, Θ⟩Φ), m

.

We adopt this general problem formulation, allowing updates to both prompts and weights of language
modules, to enable comparisons between optimization algorithms that operate in different parameter spaces
(e.g., GEPA vs. GRPO).
Sample-Efficient Optimization.
In many real-world scenarios, rollouts—concretely, invocations of Φ
plus evaluation by µ—are often computationally, monetarily, or timewise expensive. The optimizer is thus
limited to at most B rollouts on a dataset Dtrain = {(x, m)i}N
i=1 with full access to µ. The goal is to identify
parameters ⟨Π∗, Θ∗⟩Φ that maximize held-out performance, subject to not exceeding the rollout budget B:
⟨Π∗, Θ∗⟩Φ = arg max
⟨Π,Θ⟩Φ E(x,m)∼T

The core challenge, then, is: How do we extract maximal learning signal from every expensive rollout to
enable effective adaptation of complex, modular AI systems in low-data or budget-constrained settings?

GEPA: REFLECTIVE PROMPT EVOLUTION
We introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a sample-efficient optimizer for compound AI systems motivated by
three core principles: genetic prompt evolution (Section 3), reflection using natural language feedback (Sec-
tion 3), and Pareto-based candidate selection (Section 3.1). Figure 3 gives an overview of GEPA and the
full GEPA algorithm is formalized in Figure 4. GEPA receives the following inputs: A system Φ instan-
tiated with simple prompts to be optimized, training dataset Dtrain (consisting of task instances (x, m) as
described in Section 2), the standard evaluation metric µ for the task, a feedback function µf (introduced in
Section 3) and the total rollout budget B. Note that GEPA evolves only the set of prompts, denoted as ΠΦ,
whereas the underlying LLM weights, denoted by ΘΦ remains fixed.
Genetic Optimization Loop: Given an AI system Φ, the goal is to identify parameters ΠΦ that maximize
task performance. GEPA begins with a candidate pool P containing only the base system, where each can-
didate is a concrete instantiation of ⟨Π, Θfrozen⟩Φ. It then enters an optimization loop, repeatedly proposing
new candidates until the evaluation budget is exhausted. Candidates are derived from existing ones via re-
flective mutation or crossover, guided by feedback from rollouts, with each inheriting learning signals from
its parents and its own rollout so that GEPA accumulates knowledge along the genetic tree. In each iteration,
GEPA (i) selects promising candidates, (ii) proposes and evaluates a variant on a minibatch of tasks, and

Figure 3: GEPA proposes a new candidate in every iteration by improving existing candidates using one of
the two strategies (Reflective Prompt Mutation (Section 3) or System Aware Merge (Appendix D.1)), first
evaluating them on a minibatch, and if improved, evaluating on a larger dataset. Instead of selecting the
best performing candidate to mutate always, which can lead to a local-optimum, GEPA introduces Pareto-
based candidate sampling (Section 3.1), which filters and samples from the list of best candidates per task,
ensuring sufficient diversity. Overall, these design decisions allow GEPA to be highly sample-efficient while
demonstrating strong generalization.
(iii) if it outperforms its parent(s), adds it to P with ancestry records and evaluate on Dpareto, the validation
set used for selection. After the budget is exhausted, GEPA returns the candidate with the best aggregate
performance on Dpareto.
Reflective Prompt Mutation:
Natural language traces generated during the execution of a compound
AI system offer rich visibility into the behavior and responsibilities of each module, as they capture the
intermediate inferences and underlying reasoning steps. When these traces are paired with the final outcome
of the system (e.g., success or failure), they provide substantial diagnostic value, allowing practitioners to
trace errors or successes back to specific decisions made at the module level. LLMs can leverage these
traces via reflection to perform implicit credit assignment, attributing responsibility for the final outcome
to the relevant modules. This process of reflection can then be used to make targeted updates to individual
modules, making large and effective updates to the whole system’s behavior.
Given a candidate to mutate in the current iteration of the optimization loop (stochastically selected from the
Pareto-frontier, see Section 3.1 below), GEPA executes the selected candidate on a stochastically sampled
minibatch of input queries from the trainset, tracing the program’s execution. From the execution traces,
GEPA extracts the module’s inputs, outputs, and reasoning, and calls the feedback function µf, which returns
a numeric score and text feedback including details about the evaluation (like compiler error messages, failed
rubrics, etc.). GEPA selects the module (among the |M| modules that the language program contains) to be
updated based on a policy (round-robin), and a reflection LM is then shown the (current prompt, language
program trajectory, score, feedback) with the task to reflectively attribute successes or failures to prompt

Figure 4: (Left) GEPA’s core algorithm for reflective prompt evolution. GEPA works iteratively, in each
iteration, selecting some of the current candidates to evolve (line 7), executing the identified candidate on
a minibatch of rollouts, while utilizing a special feedback function µf to gather module specific feedback
when available (lines 9-10, described in detail in Section 3), using an LLM to reflectively update the prompt
(line 11), and evaluating whether the system instantiated with the new prompt improved the performance on
the minibatch (line 14). If improved, GEPA then proceeds to evaluate the new system candidate on the full
Dpareto set, adding it to the list of candidates tracked and marking the new system’s parent. (Right) The
SelectCandidate subprocedure used by GEPA’s core algorithm is tasked with identifying the best candidate to
evolve in the next optimization iteration. GEPA’s chief candidate selection strategy is to find non-dominated
candidates in the Pareto frontier (of all task instances), and stochastically select one of them based on their
appearance frequency in the Pareto front.
elements and propose revised instructions. The updated module, with the rest of the language program, is
evaluated again on the minibatch, and if the score improves, then the new program is added to the candidate
pool. The meta-prompt for reflective prompt updates is shown in Appendix C and the full algorithm is
presented in Algorithm 1.
Evaluation traces as diagnostic signals: The text that LLMs produce is the execution trace of the AI
system. The text that the environment produces to compute the reward (e.g. compiler error messages before
giving reward 0) is the evaluation trace. Beyond reflection on execution traces, we identify a second valuable
source of diagnostic information in the evaluation traces. Many evaluation metrics apply rich strategies (e.g.,
code evaluation may involve compilation, execution, and profiling), producing natural language traces before
computing a scalar reward. We propose leveraging these evaluation traces for reflective credit assignment
and targeted prompt updates. GEPA achieves this by extending rewards µ into a feedback function µf that
6

extracts textual traces during evaluation and returns them with the final score as feedback_text. When
available, such feedback can even be module-specific (e.g. in multi-hop systems the evaluator may provide
feedback after each hop). In practice, there are domains where human-graders are able to rate the AI system’s
responses, along with providing detailed feedback justifying their scalar ratings. When available, Dtrain
can be augmented with such human-written explanations for each instance; during reflection, and GEPA
can consume these explanations as auxiliary feedback_text to guide targeted prompt updates, even when
natural-language feedback from rollouts is limited or unavailable.

to substantial improvements in performance. This figure visualizes the optimization trajectory taken by
GEPA, presenting an annotated subtree from Figure 25d (for the privacy-preserving delegation task PUPA)
to demonstrate the iterative enhancements made to the prompts. The progression from the base prompt
(candidate 0) to the best performing prompt (candidate 11) is highlighted with red arrows, and key prompt
changes at each step are annotated beside the corresponding nodes. Full-length instructions for these iter-
ations are provided in Appendix K.1. Each prompt refinement in this trajectory adds targeted nuances in-
formed by ongoing optimization, illustrating how GEPA’s process accumulates lessons to continually boost
task performance.
3.1
PARETO-BASED CANDIDATE SELECTION
GEPA is a highly modular algorithm that supports various strategies for candidate selection, with the choice
of strategy governing the exploration–exploitation tradeoff. A naive approach is to always select the best-
performing candidate, but this often traps the optimizer in a local optimum: once a dominant strategy is
found, it becomes difficult to surpass, and the optimizer exhausts its budget without learning new, potentially
better strategies. Figure 6a illustrates this behavior: after finding one new strategy (the first child node), the
search repeatedly attempts to refine it, fails to improve, and ultimately depletes the budget.
To address this, GEPA employs a Pareto-based “illumination" strategy (Mouret & Clune, 2015), shown in
Algorithm 2. For each training instance, GEPA records the highest score across all candidates, forming
a Pareto frontier. Candidates that achieve the best score on at least one task are retained, while strictly
dominated ones are pruned. From this pruned set, GEPA stochastically samples a candidate, weighting

probabilities by how many tasks each candidate leads. This strategy helps GEPA escape local optima without
inflating the search, efficiently balancing exploration and exploitation by focusing resources on candidates
that embody “winning” strategies within the optimization budget.

Table 2: Benchmark results for different optimizers evaluated on GPT-4.1 Mini. As a prompt-optimization
system, GEPA works off-the-shelf on closed-source models as well, outperforming state-of-the-art prompt
optimizers including MIPROv2 (in 2 settings: Instruction-only optimization (“MIPROv2-No-Demos”) as
well as joint instruction and few-shot optimization (“MIPROv2”)), Trace (with its OptoPrime optimizer), and
TextGrad. Additionally, GEPA-optimized prompts demonstrate strong cross-model generalization: “GEPA-
Qwen-Opt”—optimized entirely for (and using) the weaker Qwen3-8B—achieves a +9% gain when eval-
uated on GPT-4.1-Mini without modification, notably outperforming all baselines (MIPROv2, TextGrad,

We adopt a standard train/validation/test split. Optimizers have full access to the train split, including text
and labels, for program tuning. Although optimizers may monitor the performance of candidate parameters
(like model checkpoints) by tracking scores on the validation set (to implement early stopping, for example),
direct access to the content of validation instances is restricted. We evaluate on six benchmarks—AIME-
2025 (Balunovi´c et al., 2025), LiveBench-Math (White et al., 2025), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), IF-
Bench (Pyatkin et al., 2025b), HoVer (Jiang et al., 2020), and PUPA (Li et al., 2025a)—each paired with
existing compound AI systems and feedback functions. Experiments use Qwen3 8B (Yang et al., 2025) and
GPT-4.1 Mini (OpenAI, 2025) with standardized inference settings, and compare against state-of-the-art
optimizers MIPROv2 (Opsahl-Ong et al., 2024), Trace (with its OptoPrime optimizer) (Cheng et al., 2024),

TextGrad (Yuksekgonul et al., 2025), and GRPO1 (Shao et al., 2024). Appendix E provides further details
on benchmarks, systems, and feedback functions (Subsection E.1); models and inference settings (Subsec-
tion E.2); monetary cost to run the experiments (Subsection E.3); and optimizer configurations (Subsec-
tion E.4). Table 1, Table 2 and Figure 10 summarize our main results, from which we derive the following
observations:
Observation 1: Reflective Prompt Evolution is highly sample-efficient and can outperform weight-
space reinforcement learning: Across four benchmarks, GEPA adapts rapidly and generalizes robustly
in compound AI systems—beating GRPO (24,000 rollouts) by up to 19% while using up to 35× fewer
rollouts. It reaches optimal test performance with 4–35× fewer rollouts and exceeds GRPO on 5 out of 6
tasks by 19.0%, 2.73%, 13.66%, 5.19% and 0.7%. GEPA matches GRPO’s best validation after only 243,
402, 330, 1143, 1179, and 306 rollouts—up to 78× greater sample efficiency. GEPA+Merge widens the
gap, outperforming GRPO by 21% at a comparable rollout budget to GEPA.
The majority of GEPA’s rollout budget is spent on validation, where scores are utilized solely for candidate
selection and not for producing learning signals. If we restrict the analysis to train set rollouts, GEPA
requires only 79 to 737 rollouts to reach optimal performance. To match GRPO’s best validation scores,
GEPA achieves this with only 102, 32, 6, and 179 train rollouts for four tasks, respectively, underscoring the
high sample efficiency of learning based on reflective prompt evolution.
Since tracking candidates’ validation performance accounts for majority of GEPA’s rollout budget, sample
efficiency can be further improved by evaluating on a smaller validation set or by tracking scores on dynam-
ically selected validation subsets instead of the full set—both of which we propose as directions for future
work. Figures 1a, 1b, 14c and 15c show the full performance-vs-rollouts curve for all optimizers over
benchmarks HotpotQA, IFBench, HoVer and PUPA, respectively.
Observation 2: Reflective prompt evolution enables instruction-optimization alone to outperform joint
instruction and few-shot optimization: We compare GEPA with MIPROv2, a state-of-the-art instruction
and few-shot optimizer, using two leading models across six diverse tasks, and observe that GEPA con-
sistently outperforms MIPROv2 in all settings, achieving margins as high as 11.1% for GPT-4.1 mini and
10.3% for Qwen3 8B. Further, GEPA and GEPA+Merge more than double the aggregate gains over baseline
seen with MIPROv2 across all benchmarks and models (+13.33% and +12.19% vs +5.64% for MIPROv2).
While prior works such as Opsahl-Ong et al. (2024) and Wan et al. (2024) have provided compelling ev-
idence for the effectiveness of few-shot example optimization—often outperforming instruction-based ap-
proaches—our findings suggest an exciting shift in this trend. We attribute this primarily to recent advances
in the instruction-following and self-reflective abilities of LLMs, as well as the design choices in GEPA
that capitalize on these improved capabilities. To further contextualize our findings, we redo the study on
generalization gap (the difference between validation and test set performance for optimized prompts) as
proposed by Wan et al. (2024). The results presented in Figure 16 reinforce these observations: reflectively
evolved instructions now demonstrate a lower generalization gap, underscoring both advancements in model
capabilities and the benefits of GEPA’s design. We see this as a reflection of the continuous evolution of
LLMs and GEPA’s ability to effectively leverage these improvements.
We provide the full-length optimized prompts produced by GEPA for all systems, benchmarks, and mod-
els in Appendix L, alongside MIPROv2 prompts. Notably, in contrast to prior findings where instruction
optimization yielded improvements primarily through quasi-exemplars (Wan et al., 2024), GEPA’s prompts
frequently contain detailed declarative instructions for completing the task, as illustrated in Figure 2.
1We use LoRA for GRPO due to its low cost and succesful adoption with GRPO (Wang et al., 2025b; Xu et al.,
2025b; Li et al., 2025b; Yue et al., 2025; Sun et al., 2025; Hayou et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2025; Teknium et al., 2024;
Zhao et al., 2024; Sidahmed et al., 2024). Additionally, we explore full-parameter finetuning. Figure 11 shows a similar
result comparing GEPA to GRPO with full finetuning.

Observation 3: The next-candidate selection strategy strongly influences the optimization trajectory
and final performance, with Pareto-based sampling providing a distinct advantage.
Table 3: Comparing candidate selection strategies across different tasks with Qwen3 8B while keeping the
evolution harness fixed. At each step, SelectBestCandidate (used by TextGrad Yuksekgonul et al. (2025))
evolves only from the top-scoring candidate. BeamSearch maintains a pool of the top-N candidates (used by
APO Pryzant et al. (2023)), but is still prone to local optima. In comparison, GEPA’s Pareto-based selection
yields a +12.44% improvement, significantly outperforming the +6.05% and +5.11% gains of greedy and
beam-search strategies respectively.

(b) Pareto-based candidate sampling.
Figure 6: Comparing the impact of different candidate selection strategies. (Left) As can be seen, selecting
the best-performing candidate in every iteration led to a local-optima after one iteration, leading to subopti-
mal search performance. (Right) On the other hand, using pareto-based candidate selection strategy, GEPA
was able to generate a balanced search tree, finding a better performing program within the same budget.
GEPA refines prompts iteratively with rollout feedback; to test our Pareto-based selection, we compare
against a baseline that always picks the best-performing candidate in the SelectBestCandidate strategy
(which is similar to the strategy used by TextGrad Yuksekgonul et al. (2025)), and BeamSearch(N=4) (used
by APO Pryzant et al. (2023)). As shown in Table 3, these baselines often yield suboptimal exploration
of the prompt search space, leading to poor performance. GEPA with Pareto-based sampling outperforms
the BeamSearch strategy by upto 11.33%, and SelectBestCandidate strategy by up to 8.17%, with an
aggregate margin of +7.33% and +6.4% across all benchmarks, respectively. Figure 6 highlights the differ-
ence in optimization trajectories: always choosing the current best candidate gives immediate improvement
but quickly stalls, wasting rollouts on a single candidate. In contrast, our Pareto-based method expands
10

the search by considering all Pareto-optimal candidates (all “winning” strategies found so far), balancing
exploration and exploitation and converging to a higher-performing solution within the same rollout budget.
Observation 4: Instruction-optimized prompts are computationally cheaper and generalize better
than few-shot demonstration prompts: In addition to their strong generalization capabilities, reflectively
evolved instructions offer a significant practical advantage: they are often much shorter and thus computa-
tionally more efficient than few-shot demonstration prompts. This advantage becomes especially clear for
complex tasks, where even a single few-shot demonstration can be prohibitively long. The problem is further
exacerbated when few-shot examples are optimized using state-of-the-art methods such as MIPROv2, which
jointly optimizes multiple demonstrations to be used simultaneously, further increasing prompt length.
In contrast, reflectively evolved instructions—such as those generated by GEPA—maintain compactness
while providing large performance gains (as demonstrated in Lessons 1 and 2). To illustrate this, we com-
pare GEPA’s and MIPROv2’s prompt lengths (see Figure 18). Notably, prompts produced by GEPA and
GEPA+Merge are up to 9.2× shorter than those from MIPROv2, representing a substantial improvement in
efficiency, alongside performance improvements.
Moreover, we observe a trend where, in aggregate, optimizers that achieve higher performance tend to
produce shorter prompts (see Figure 17). This reduction in prompt size has a significant impact—not only
reducing runtime cost for downstream tasks (as all API-providers meter the input tokens), but also decreasing
latency and improving the overall efficiency of LLM-serving systems (Kwon et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2024;
Agrawal et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2025).
Observation 5: System aware crossover strategies can provide large gains, but the optimal budget allo-
cation between mutation and crossover, as well as when to invoke merge needs further study: We iden-
tify a unique system-aware crossover strategy and operationalize it as Merge (described in Appendix D.1).
GEPA+Merge can outperform GEPA by as much as 5%, providing an aggregate 2% additional improvement
over the already strong performance established by GEPA. Detailed results are available in Table 1. We
attribute these gains to the ability of GEPA+Merge to identify distinct optimization lineages, that have learnt
complementary strategies (by evolving distinct modules), and merging them by picking the best version of
different modules from each of these lineages to propose a single, optimal candidate.
While in our analysis, we found GEPA+Merge works especially well for GPT-4.1 Mini, it lead to perfor-
mance degradation when used with Qwen3 8B. Even Qwen3 8B benefits from Merge on one out of four
tasks. We attribute these discrepancies to the way the rollout budget is allocated between reflective mu-
tation and crossover, and the timing of invocation of the crossover strategy. In our experiments, we fixed
the same hyperparameters for GPT-4.1 Mini and Qwen3 8B, leading to suboptimal choice for Qwen3 8B.
Intuitively, crossover would provide the maximum benefit, when there are independent lineages that perform
well. Hence, the hyperparameters should be chosen such that Merge is invoked once the optimization tree
has evolved sufficiently different lineages. We propose the study of such adaptive techniques as future work.
Observation 6: GEPA-optimized prompts demonstrate cross-model generalization. Table 2 presents
results for “GEPA-Qwen-Opt”, a configuration where prompts were optimized using the smaller Qwen3-8B
model but evaluated on GPT-4.1-Mini. Despite originating from a weaker model in a different family, these
prompts transfer effectively, achieving a +9.00% aggregate improvement across 6 benchmarks (with gains
as high as +27.67% on HotpotQA). Remarkably, this transfer performance outperforms strong baselines like
MIPROv2 (+5.64%), TextGrad (+6.11%), and Trace (+3.27%), even though those methods were optimized
directly on the target GPT-4.1-Mini model.

EXTENDED APPLICATIONS OF GEPA
5.1
GEPA FOR INFERENCE-TIME SEARCH (CONTD.)
While the primary focus of this paper is sample-efficient adaptation of AI systems to new tasks, preliminary
findings suggest that GEPA may also serve as a promising inference-time search technique. This can be
achieved by passing the set of tasks to be solved (for example, a list of Pytorch modules to be converted
to CUDA) as the training set to GEPA, ensuring that both Dtrain and Dpareto contain the full set of tasks.
This way, GEPA can “overfit” the set of tasks, iteratively proposing better solutions to every problem. We
also note that this allows GEPA to apply lessons and insights extracted from rollouts for one task to other
tasks. To explore this use case, we conduct preliminary experiments using GEPA as an inference-time
search technique for code-generation tasks on two hardware platforms: writing kernels for AMD’s recently
introduced XDNA2 Architecture (Advanced Micro Devices, 2025) using an early version of the NPUEval
benchmark (Kalade & Schelle, 2025), and generating CUDA code for NVIDIA-V100 GPUs using Kernel-
Bench (Ouyang et al., 2025).
A distinguishing aspect of these experiments is the use of the feedback function µf to dynamically inject
domain-specific knowledge into the optimization process. Specifically, kernel development expertise—often
codified in technical manuals and documentation—can be selectively surfaced by retrieving relevant man-
ual sections based on rollout failures (e.g., compiler error messages). By using error information to make
targetted retrieval queries, GEPA promotes integration of architectural best practices into prompt evolu-
tion, as exemplified by the detailed prompt for NPUEval shown in Figure 27. We also note that generation
stochasticity (temperature based sampling) is eliminated by operating under a cache; this ensures that ob-
served improvements tie closely to inference scaling through prompt updates and GEPA’s diverse prompt
exploration, rather than stochasticity in the model’s sampling process.
NPU Kernels: We create a sequential refinement agent that iteratively generates kernels (up to 10 times)
based on feedback like compiler errors and profiling results (Sequential10), and evaluate the Best-of-N
generation. With GPT-4o alone, Sequential10 reaches only 4.25% mean vector utilization. Adding RAG,
sourced from technical manuals, improves this to 16.33%, and integrating MIPROv2 further raises it to
19.03%. Notably, applying GEPA to Sequential10 (without RAG) dramatically boosts kernel performance,
with several generated kernels achieving up to 70% vector utilization and a mean of 30.52%. Furthermore,
a single prompt generated by GEPA enables Sequential10 (again without RAG) to attain a score of 26.85%.
CUDA Kernels: For 35 tasks from the KernelBench “representative subset” (Ouyang et al., 2025), spanning
three difficulty levels, we ran GEPA with GPT-4o. As depicted in Figure 8, GEPA boosts GPT-4o’s close-
to-0% fast1 score to above 20% with increasing search budget. This task used an agent that could generate
upto 5 sequential refinements based on environment feedback (Sequential5).
These experiments with GPT-4o also demonstrate GEPA’s ability to leverage the abilities of frontier LLMs.
However, these are early results and warrant further systematic study. We believe that leveraging GEPA for
inference-time search, particularly when coupled with domain specific textual feedback, could generalize to
other code generation and domain adaptation tasks—a direction we leave for future work.
5.2
GEPA FOR ADVERSARIAL PROMPT SEARCH (CONTD.)
We instantiate GEPA for adversarial prompt search by inverting the reward signal: the optimizer proposes
prompt edits to include additional information like trivia that minimize task performance (pass@1), while
requiring that prompts do not contradict the task and still contain all information needed to solve it. For
AIME, GEPA’s adversarial search used AIME 2022–2024 problems as the pool for prompt evolution. The
learned prompt was evaluated on AIME-2025 (30 problems), using GPT-5 Mini with 5 runs per problem

(150 generations total). We started from a clean instruction prompt and evolved a single universal adversarial
instruction that is prepended to each query.
The learned adversarial instruction reduced pass@1 on AIME-2025 from 76% (clean prompt) to 10% (ad-
versarial prompt), despite preserving the nominal task description and the required answer-format directive.
Base (clean) prompt:
You are a helpful assistant. You are given a question and you need to answer it. The answer
should be given at the end of your response in exactly the format ‘### <final answer>’.
GEPA-generated adversarial prompt (abridged):
You are a helpful assistant. You are given a question and you need to answer it. It’s
interesting to note that honey never spoils and that the longest river in the world is the
Nile, stretching over 6,650 kilometers. When providing your answer, be sure to format it
at the end of your response exactly as ‘### <final answer>’. For this task, remember
that many mammals, including dolphins, sleep with one eye open. Proceed to answer the
given question accordingly.
Manual inspection showed that the adversarial prompt caused GPT-5 Mini to end most responses with the lit-
eral placeholder ### <final answer>, indicating a systematic misinterpretation of the formatting rule when
paired with the injected distractors. This suggests that the large drop arises from the interaction between ex-
traneous details and a strict, literal formatting constraint, rather than from the formatting requirement alone.
Adversarial prompt search systematically uncovers instruction-level perturbations that sharply degrade
model performance, providing a principled, automated way to probe worst-case robustness beyond average-
case metrics. By finding universal, task-preserving distractors (e.g., trivia plus strict formatting), it reveals
brittle instruction-following interactions and turns them into reusable stress tests and regression suites for
continuous evaluation. The resulting adversarial prompts could be used to provide targeted data for fine-
tuning or safety training. In practice, this could improve deployment reliability, enables red-teaming at
scale, and help track robustness drift over time across models, versions, and domains.

RELATED WORK
Prompt optimization improves LLMs but often needs manual expertise; for instance, chain-of-thought
prompting Wei et al. (2023). To scale this approach, recent methods use LLMs to optimize prompts auto-
matically (Zhou et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2024; Agarwal et al., 2024; Fernando et al., 2024). GEPA leverages
LLMs, but differs by incorporating textual environment feedback, Pareto-aware search over candidates, and
evolution strategies per submodule within an AI system.
Evolutionary algorithms have been used to optimize prompts, e.g., EvoPrompt (Guo et al., 2024), which
evolves prompt populations. Rainbow Teaming (Samvelyan et al., 2024) applies quality-diversity evolution
to generate diverse adversarial prompts. GEPA additionally uses domain-specific feedback for targeted mu-
tations achieving higher sample efficiency. AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al., 2025) and OpenEvolve (Sharma,
2025) apply evolutionary search directly to code rewriting, excelling when problem solution can be codi-
fied. While AlphaEvolve targets a single hard problem, GEPA brings evolution to prompts across domains,
combining Pareto-frontier optimization and prompt evolution to transfer tactics from related problems.
Feedback-driven improvement often uses reinforcement learning, such as majority voting signals (Zuo
et al., 2025), but RL can be sample-inefficient when rewards are slow to compute. An alternative is learning
in the language space: in-context bandit/self-bootstrapping methods (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023)
(Monea et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025a; Feng et al., 2025; Cheng et al., 2024), workflow memory and skills

(Wang et al., 2024; 2025c), and test-time strategy synthesis via Dynamic Cheatsheet (Suzgun et al., 2025),
reasoning cache (Chen et al., 2025c). GEPA instead uses examples to propose new instructions, yielding
task-specific rules.
To optimize compound AI systems and agents (Lin et al., 2025b), DSPy (Khattab et al., 2022; 2024)
searches/bootstraps few-shot examples, TextGrad (Yuksekgonul et al., 2025) backpropagates textual feed-
back, and MIPROv2 (Opsahl-Ong et al., 2024) jointly aligns instructions and examples via Bayesian opti-
mization; these largely rely on global rewards. Agent-Pro (Zhang et al., 2024) evolves agent policies through
dynamic belief generation and reflection on interactive experiences. Optimas (Wu et al., 2025a) introduces
globally aligned local rewards per module. GEPA combines global rewards with environment textual feed-
back per module and maintains a Pareto frontier over individual data instances, matching prompts/agent
design to specific examples. The Pareto-guided evolution lets GEPA explore diverse prompt/code/agent
design strategies before converging to a robust, generalizable set.

CONCLUSION
We introduced GEPA, a prompt optimizer for arbitrary LLM agents and workflows that leverages explicit re-
flection and Pareto-based selection, showing superior sample efficiency compared to reinforcement learning
(GRPO), while outperforming leading prompt optimizers (MIPROv2). By explicitly incorporating natural
language feedback and maintaining a diverse pool of Pareto-optimal candidates, GEPA rapidly adapts AI
systems to new tasks. Our results across benchmarks and models suggest that language-based reflection can
offer a scalable strategy for optimizing complex real-world AI workflows, especially in resource-constrained
settings. GEPA also shows promise as an inference-time search strategy, showing the ability to write code
in challenging domains.

USAGE OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS
The authors used large language models (LLMs) only for polishing prose of text where the complete draft
was fully written by the authors initially and polished later with the help of LLM-based assistants including
ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity. The authors’ used code assistants including Cursor and Copilot to imple-
ment the authors’ original design and ideas. The scientific contributions, technical methods, ideas and core
results are entirely the original work of the authors.

GEPA’S REFLECTION AND PROMPT UPDATE META PROMPT
GEPA’s Meta Prompt
I provided an assistant with the following instructions to perform a task for me:
```
<current instruction>
```
The following are examples of different task inputs provided to the assistant along with
the assistant's response for each of them, and some feedback on how the assistant's
response could be better:
```
<Inputs, Outputs and Feedback for minibatch of examples>
```
Your task is to write a new instruction for the assistant.

Accepted at ICLR 2026 (Oral).
Read the inputs carefully and identify the input format and infer detailed task
description about the task I wish to solve with the assistant.
Read all the assistant responses and the corresponding feedback. Identify all niche and
domain specific factual information about the task and include it in the instruction, as
a lot of it may not be available to the assistant in the future. The assistant may have
utilized a generalizable strategy to solve the task, if so, include that in the
instruction as well.
Provide the new instructions within ``` blocks.
Figure C shows the meta-prompt used by GEPA, which guides the LLM to reflectively refine its current
instruction based on input–output examples and corresponding feedback from the environment.

GEPA ALGORITHM AND METHODOLOGY DETAILS
Figure 4 presents the core GEPA Algorithm, along with the algorithm for Pareto-based candidate selection.
D.1
MERGE: SYSTEM-AWARE CROSSOVER STRATEGY FOR COMPOUND AI OPTIMIZATION
Algorithm 4 provides the instantiation of the System aware Merge strategy used in GEPA+Merge. Intuitively,
merge will be helpful when there are candidates in the pool that learn complementary strategies. Algorithm 3
defines the selection criteria: candidates are merged only if they share a common ancestor but have optimized
disjoint sets of prompts (complementary strategies), are pareto-optimal, and both candidates improve upon
the aggregate performance of the ancestor. GEPA routinely checks if the pool has 2 such candidates, invoking
merge when identified. These strict lineage conditions mean merge occurs sparsely.

EVALUATION SETUP (CONTD.)
E.1
BENCHMARKS, REFERENCE COMPOUND AI SYSTEMS, AND FEEDBACK FUNCTIONS
To rigorously evaluate the performance of GEPA and and compare it against current state-of-the-art com-
pound AI system optimizers, we assemble a diverse suite of benchmarks mostly obtained from Tan et al.
(2025), each paired with available Compound AI Systems.
HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018) is a large-scale question-answering dataset consisting of 113K Wikipedia-
based question-answer pairs. It features questions that require reasoning over multiple supporting docu-
ments. We modify the last hop of the HoVerMultiHop program (described below) to answer the question
instead of generating another query, and the rest of the system remains unmodified. The textual feedback
module identifies the set of relevant documents remaining to be retrieved at each stage of the program, and
provides that as feedback to the modules at that stage. We use 150 examples for training, 300 for validation,
and 300 for testing.
IFBench (Pyatkin et al., 2025b) introduced a benchmark specifically designed to assess language models’
ability to follow precise human instructions, especially output constraints (e.g., “answer only with yes or no”,
or “mention a word at least three times”). The IFBench test set consists of 58 new and out-of-distribution
output constraints and instructions to test system’s ability to generalize to new task constraints. Pyatkin et al.
(2025b) also release IFTrain and IF-RLVR Train data (Pyatkin et al., 2025a) which are used for training.

We split the IF-RLVR Train into our train/val sets, and IFBench as our test set in order to ensure that the
optimizers do not access the new, unseen constraints being tested in IFBench. We design a 2-stage system,
that first attempts to answer the user query, and then in the second stage, rewrites the answer following the
constraints. The textual feedback module provides the descriptions of constraints satsified and failed-to-be-
satisifed by the system’s response. Our splits contain 150 training examples, 300 for validation, and 294 for
testing.
AIME-2025 (Balunovi´c et al., 2025) The AIME-2025 benchmark consists of 2 problem sets of 15 questions
each (total 30) obtained from the AIME examination conducted by Mathematical Association of America.
24

Accepted at ICLR 2026 (Oral).
We use prior years AIME questions (2022-2024 totalling 90 questions) split equally into training and vali-
dation set, and use the AIME-2025 questions, repeating each question 5 times, as the final test set. We use a
single-step ChainOfThought as the AI system under optimization.
LiveBench-Math White et al. (2025) LiveBench is a cross-domain benchmark consisting of regularly up-
dated questions. We use the math subset of LiveBench questions retrieved on July 30, 2025. This set of
questions (n=368) is shuffled (with python random seed 0) and split equally into train/val/test questions. We
use a single-step ChainOfThought as the AI system under optimization.
HoVer (Jiang et al., 2020) is an open-domain multihop fact extraction and claim verification benchmark
built on a Wikipedia-based corpus requiring complex reasoning across multiple sentences and documents,
typically involving multiple wikipedia articles. Following Tan et al. (2025), the systems are evaluated for
their ability to write queries in multiple hops to retrieve all relevant wikipedia documents (gold documents)
required to make the claim. We obtain the HoverMultiHop program from Tan et al. (2025), which performs
up to 3-hop retrievals using 2 query writer modules, and 2 document summary modules. The textual feed-
back module simply identifies the set of correct documents retrieved, and the set of documents remaining to
be retrieved, and returns them as feedback text. For the full-parameter finetuning results demonstrated in fig-
ure 11, we instantiate a 2-hop program, where the first hop is performed with the initial claim, and the LLM
is prompted in a single turn with the claim and first-hop retrieved documents, to provide the second-hop
search query. For HoVer, we use 150 examples for training, 300 for validation, and 300 for testing.
PUPA (Li et al., 2025a) propose the task of Privacy-Conscious Delegation: addressing real-world user
queries using an ensemble of trusted and untrusted models. The core challenges are maintaining high re-
sponse quality while minimizing leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) to untrusted models.
Li et al. (2025a) also present PAPILLON, a compound AI system consisting of 2 modules, a user query
rewriter and a response rewriter, run over the trusted model, along with an intermediate call to the untrusted
model with the rewritten query. The feedback text simply provides the breakdown of the aggregate score,
consisting of a response quality score and a PII leakage score. The dataset is split into 111 training examples,
111 for validation, and 221 for testing.
E.2
MODELS AND INFERENCE PARAMETERS
We evaluate GEPA and baseline optimizers using two contemporary LLMs, chosen to represent both open-
source and commercial model families. Each compound AI system is instantiated once per model, with all
modules (e.g., retrievers, rewriters, answer generators) relying on the same model. All models are allowed a
context window of upto 16384 tokens for inference.
Qwen3 8B (Yang et al., 2025): For our open-source experiments (including GRPO), we use Qwen3-8B.
Following the recommended settings as per Team (2025), we use a decoding temperature of 0.6, top-p of
0.95, and top-k of 20 for training as well as inference.
GPT-4.1 Mini (OpenAI, 2025): For comparison with large commercial models, we use GPT-4.1 mini
(openai/gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14) accessed via the OpenAI API with a model temperature of 1.0.
E.3
COSTS
It costs under $500 to run all experiments in Table 2 with GPT-4.1 mini. Specifically, GEPA costs a total of
$86, GEPA-Merge costs $67, MIPROv2 costs $76, and Trace and TextGrad cost $172 in total.
E.4
OPTIMIZERS
Baseline: The base program is directly evaluated without any further optimization applied.
25

Accepted at ICLR 2026 (Oral).
MIPROv2 (Opsahl-Ong et al., 2024): MIPROv2 is a widely used compound AI system prompt optimizer
and has been integrated into the DSPy (Khattab et al., 2024) and llama-prompt-ops (AI, 2025) frameworks.
It works by jointly optimizing both instructions and demonstrations using Bayesian optimization. For each
program module, it first bootstraps candidate sets of instructions and demonstrations, assigning uniform
priors over their utilities. Candidate assignments are proposed with the Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator
(TPE), and the Bayesian model is updated based on evaluation scores to favor high-performing candidates.
The most probable sets of instructions and demonstrations are then selected and validated to obtain the final
optimized program configuration.
All MIPROv2 optimization runs are performed with the auto = heavy setting, which corresponds to propos-
ing 18 instruction candidates and 18 bootstrapped few-shot sets. Hence, across benchmarks, the exact num-
ber of rollouts varies depending on the number of trials it takes to bootstrap examples (finding 18 successful
solution instances), the required number of Bayesian search steps (determined by the number of modules
in the system), and size of the valset. Overall, MIPROv2’s rollouts ranged from a minimum of 2270 (for
PUPA) to maximum of 6926 (for HoVer).
Trace and TextGrad (Cheng et al., 2024; Yuksekgonul et al., 2025): We implement both optimizers in the
Trace framework. All programs under optimization have the exact same architecture compared to the DSPy
implementation. To ensure a fair comparison, we port all the DSPy specific signature and parsing prompt
to Trace, and use the same initial prompt. In addition, all the test, train, and validation data match exactly
the experiment we used for GEPA. The performance of the unoptimized Trace program baseline closely
matched our baseline implementation in DSPy (within 0.5% difference). All optimization experiments were
under the same rollout budget as MIPROv2 and GEPA. We also provide both optimizer the same metric and
feedback functions as GEPA, and, for the per-module feedback function that is not available in Trace (both
optimizer do not support per-module feedback), we followed the feedback format in the BigBench-Hard
tutorial2 from the Trace authors.
GRPO (Shao et al., 2024): Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a reinforcement learning algo-
rithm that estimates advantages in a group-relative manner. For compound AI systems consisting of multiple
modules, we use the GRPO implementation provided and open-sourced by Ziems et al. (2025) to perform
our experiments, whereas for single-module systems (e.g., figure 11), we use the GRPO implementation
provided by SkyRL (Griggs et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025; Cao et al., 2025).
Across all compound system training runs, each training step uses a group size of 12, with 4 training in-
stances per step (total batch size 48, with per device train batch size 1). Training employs LoRA (Hu et al.,
2022) with rank dimension 16, α = 64, and dropout 0.05, using bf16 precision targeting the projection
modules [q, k, v, o, up, down, gate]. We use a learning rate of 1 × 10−5, β = 0.01, reward scale normaliza-
tion, and gradient norm clipping of 0.1. Gradients are accumulated for 20 steps before each update, with a
“constant with warmup learning” rate scheduler. Non-reentrant gradient checkpointing is enabled to further
reduce memory usage. GRPO optimization run for 500 training steps, amounting to fixed 24,000 rollouts,
with validation performed every 20 training steps, which is used to implement early stopping. Compound AI
system GRPO training experiments are performed on 1xH100/A100 (80 GB memory) with separate GPUs
for inference rollouts.
For single-module GRPO training, we adopt full-parameter finetuning with a group size of 16. Each training
step employs a global batch size of 32, realized as per-device micro-batches of 4 across 8 GPUs. Roll-
out generation is performed with a per-GPU forward micro-batch size of 12. Training is distributed using
FSDP2, with sampling performed at temperature 1.0. We apply KL regularization and set the learning rate
to 1 × 10−6. Validation is conducted every 5 training steps. During evaluation, sampling is performed with
temperature 0.6, top-p = 0.95, and top-k = 20.

We manually explore several values for [LR, beta, norm clipping] hyperparameters for both training runs.
GEPA: GEPA is our optimizer, based on the algorithm described in Section 3. We evaluate 2 variants of our
main optimizer GEPA: GEPA and GEPA+Merge, along with 2 ablations created by replacing the Pareto-
based sampling strategy with a naive, SelectBestCandidate strategy (SelectBestCandidate and SelectBest-
Candidate+Merge). All GEPA optimization runs use a minibatch size of 3, and merge is invoked a maximum
of 5 times during the optimization run, when enabled. To ensure a fair comparison with MIPROv2, we align
the computational budget between GEPA and MIPROv2 on a per-benchmark basis. The training set from
each benchmark is used as Dfeedback (which is used to derive the training signals, as discussed in Section 3)
and the validation set is used as Dpareto. Specifically, since MIPROv2’s total rollout budget depends on fac-
tors such as validation set size and the number of modules, we first record the number of rollouts expended
by MIPROv2 for each benchmark, and then cap GEPA’s optimization to match this rollout budget. While
differences in proposal and validation procedures cause the exact budget usage by the systems to be slightly
different, the discrepancy is always within 10.15%. This protocol ensures that any performance differences
arise from the optimization algorithms themselves, rather than from differences in search budget. The exact
rollout counts for each optimizer is visualized in Appendix G.

COST VS. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS FOR OPTIMIZED SYSTEMS
The prompt size of the optimized system plays an important role in determining the downstream cost of
using the optimized system. Figure 17 visualizes the aggregate prompt lengths of the final optimized system
(as cost proxy) for each optimizer, against the performance achieved. Notably, GEPA’s prompts are around
33% shorter than MIPROv2’s prompts, while achieving higher performance.
